2 10 διὰ τὸ φεύγειν τὴν ἄγνοιαν ἐφιλοσόφησαν, ‘the great discrepancy of
opinions is an evidence that the cause or starting-point of philosophy
was the painful consciousness of ignorance, and that the Academics
are justified in refusing to make any affirmation on points where certainty
is unattainable ². (See Krische p. 7.) But this explanation is unsatis-
factory on several grounds ; (1) there is no reason for making any refer-
ence to the origin of philosophy, (2) the present discrepancy of opinions is
no argument as to what may have been the origin of philosophy, (3) the
origin of philosophy is in no way connected with the Academic principle
(itself the result of a long history of philosophy) that man must be content
with probability, (4) bare ignorance is very far from being the cause of
philosophy, and it would be an altogether wrong use of words to make
inscientiam& φεύγειν τὴν ἄγνοιαν, (ὅ) principium pkdocoplzandi would have

· , been a more appropriate expression for the supposed sense. Nor is it much

more satisfactory to interpret the clause as affirming that the Socratic
confession of ignorance is the starting- point of philosophy' m the individual
(cssAa144). Ifwe retain the ordinary reading, Ithink itisbesttotakeit
as giving the sceptical view, ‘the cause and origin of this whole windbag of
philosophy is ignorance’, cf. Sext. Emp. Math. 11 29 τὸ πολύτροπον τῆς
ἀποφάσεως (παρὰ τοῖς δογματικαῖς φιλοσόφοις) τὴν ἀγνωσίαν τοῦ παντὸς
ἀληθοῦς ἐπισφραγίζεται. But though such language may have been wd
by Hortensius and others (Ru. 1 2), it is hardly conceivable that O. should
have adopted it as his own. I should prefer therefore to follow Ursinus
(if one only knew what his us. wasl) or Heind„ whose reading gives an
excellent sense though somewhat clumsil y expressed: ⁴ the discrepancy of
opinions proves that they all sprang from ignorance, and that the Aca-
demics are right in refusing to make any positive assertion. ' The interpo-
lation of the clause omitted by him would be easily accounted for by the
supposition that id principium philosophiae was a gloss on the words
Academicos assensionem cohibuisse, meaning that this was the leading prin-
ciple of their philosophy. The variety of opinions was the lOth of the
common-places used by. the Sceptics to prove that knowledge was un-
attainable‚ see Sext. Emp. Hyp. 1 14 145. Baiter, in order to keep the
εἰπε of the majority of uss, inserts cum, reading debent for debeat in
apodosi, but this is awkward after cum multam and it is also more natural
to introduce the discrepancy of opinion as a distinct statement to be
proved by what follows, velut in hac quaestione, rather than to refer to it as
’ already known. Orelli follows Ernesti in inserting id before mafflzo, an
