’ BOOK 1 cn. xxv §69- 167

Oh. xxv ξ 69. hoc persaepe facitis—possit. Three examples follow, (1)
the declination of atonis, (2) the denial of the disjunctive judgment (ξ 70

idem facit cmttra dialecticos), (3) the assertion of the infallibility of sensa-
tions (ξ 70 omnes sensus veri nuntios), all preparing the way for (4), with
which we are here concerned (ξ 71 ιἰῑεπι facit in natura deorum). The
same points are criticized elsewhere by O. ag. (l) in Mn. 1 19, Fae. 22,
463 (2) in Ac. 11 97, Fac. 18 foll. ; (3) Ac. 11 79, see the following notes,

ut satius fuerit. Satius est being used in the Ind. like aeq-uim eet,

melius est, where we might have expected the Subj. (see n. on lonqum est ·

ξ 19), satim fuit would mean ‘ would have been better '. It is here
subordinated to ut, like molestum sit in ξ 2.

si atomi-suopte pondere. This was the only natural and necessary
movement of the atoms according to Dem. ; but since the lai-ger and heavier
atoms overtook the smaller and lighter in their downward descent, by
striking against them, they initiated a secondary movement, which might
be in any direction, but which resulted finally in the creative vortex. The
authorities on which this account rests are given by Zeller, who points out
that some of the ancient writers neglected to notice the original movement,
and made Dem. assume as his first principle, either the motion of mutual
impact, πληγή (as Cic. Fat. 46 aziam quandam vim metm habebant (atomi)
a Democrito impulsionis, a ce Epicure gravitatis et ponder-22⁹), or even the
resulting vortex, δίνη (eg. Diog. L. 11 44 φέρεσθαι ἐν τῷ ὅλῳ δινουμένας τὰς
ἀτόμους).

nihil fore in nostra potestate. Epicurus ap. Diog. L. x 134 speaks of
the blessedness of the man who has learnt that necessity, to which others
assign a despotic power, is only a name for the results of chance or of
man’s free will, ε’πεὶ κρεῖττον ἥν τῷ περὶ θεῶν μύθῳ κατακολουθεῖν ἢ τῇ τᾶν
φυσικῶν εἱμαρμένῃ δουλεύειν· ὅ μὲν γὰρ ε’λπίδα παραιτήσεως ὑπογράφει θεῶν
διὰ τιμῆς, ἦ δὲ ἀπαραίτητον ἔχει τὴν ἀνάγκην. The same reason is assigned
for the introduction of the dinanum in Fac. 22 foll. (cf. 46 foll.) Epicwm
veritus eet, ne, εἰ semper atomus qravitate serretur naturali ac necessaria, amic
liberum nobis esset, cum ita moveretur animus ut atomorum motu coyeretur,
to which the Academic disputant replies (l) that the single downward
movement does not necessarily involve the doctrine of necessity, and (2)
that in any case the supposition of the clinamen would not avert such a
consequence. Philodemm, in his treatise περὶ σημείων (Gomp. p. 44), allows
that this movement cannot be proved from the fact of free will, unless it is
consistent with our experience on all points, οὐχ ἱκανὸν εἰς τὸ προσδέξασθαι
τὰς ἐπ’ ἐλάχιστον παρεγκλίσεις τῶν ἀτόμων διὰ τὸ τυχηρὸν καὶ τὸ παρ’ ἡμᾶς ,

(causal use of παρα) ἀλλὰ δεῖ προσεπιδεῖξαι καὶ τὸ μηδαμῶς ετέρφ μάχεσθαι
τῶν ἐναργῶν. Accordingly we find another reason given in Pin. 1 19 viz.

that as all atoms move at the same rate in vacuo (ουτ-ε γὰρ τὰ βαρέα θᾶττον

οισθήσεται μικρῶν καὶ κούφων,” οταν γε δὴ μηδέν’ απαντᾷ αυτοῖς· Diog. L. x 61)...
a point in which Ep. corrected the erroneous doctrine of his predecessor—

there was no possibility of one overtaking the other, but all must move
