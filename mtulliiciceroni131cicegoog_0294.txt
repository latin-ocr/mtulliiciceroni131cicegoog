ς 119 fortes ad deos pervenisse. It has been already stated
(ἕξ 38, 39) that Persaeus and Chrysippus held this view, which ιε also
maintained by Balbus (11 62), cf. Zeller Stoica, p. 330, Dollinger GenttZe
and Jew 1 p. 343, 11 32, 165 f011.; but it would seem that Ο. has wrongly
identified with theirs the doctrine of Euhemerus, who acc. to Sext. l. c. sup-
posed this worship to have been instituted during the life-time of its founders,

Euhemerus: fi. 300 Β.ο., sent on an exploring expedition to the Red
Sea by Cassander, the results of which he professed to recount in his
‘Sacred fflcords' (ἱερὰ ἀναγραφή). In this he gave a long account of an
island named Panchaia, lying towards the south, in which there was a
temple of Zeus Triphylius, uhi auream columnam positam ceos ab ipco Jove
tz'tulus indicabat ; in qua columna qesta sua perca-ijm't wc ”tenimentum
esset posceris rerum suarum, Lact. 1 11. Euhemerus is the chief repre-
sentative of the praqmatizz’nq or rationalistic mythologists, but traces of
the same tendency may be seen in Hecataeus and Herodotus, and much
more in Ephorus, and Dionysius of Miletus, whose Atlantis is described
by Diod. 11 51, 55 foll. Of. Keightley Hymet. c. 2, Dollinger Lo. 1 34⁵,

‘the tomb of Jupiter is shown in the Cretan Onossus, and on it is inscribed
in ancient characters ZAN ΚΡΟΝΟΥ ’ (Lect. 1. 11). The influenoe of
Ennius’ work is seen in Virg- Aen. vn 47, 177, vm 355, (ἔσο. 11 1³9. It

as by Sext. l. ο. e‘ ἐπικληθεὶς ὅθεοε, and Plut. H. p. 360 Δ, πᾶσαν ἀθεότητα

the sun, the heavens, &a (Euseb. Pr. Ev. 11 2) and to have represented Zeus
as offering sacrifice to Aether (Lact. 1 11).
