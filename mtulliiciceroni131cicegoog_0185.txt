ἀραιοῦ (the fine clement of fite) τὴν δὲ ἐκ τοῦ πυκνοῦ (the gross element,
earth) μικτὰς δὲ ἄλλας ἐκ φωτὸς καὶ σκάτους μεταξὺ τούτων· καὶ τὸ περιέχον
δὲ πάσας τείχους δίκην, στερεὸν ὑπάρχειν, ὑφ’ ᾧ πυρώδης στεφάνη· καὶ τὸ
μεσαίτατον πασόν (is solid also) περὶ ὃν πάλιν nuspiam· τῶν δὲ συμμιγῶν τὴν
μεσοιτάτην (the fiery ring just mentioned which lies in the middle of
all the composite tinge) άπάσαις τοκέα πάσης κινήσεως καὶ γενέσεως ὖπάρ·
χειν, ἥντινα καὶ δαίμονα καὶ κυβέρνητιν καὶ κλῃδοῦχον ὀνομάζει, δίκην τε καὶ
ἀνάγκην. From this it is plain that Ο. is mistaken in ascribing divinity to
the orbem qui cingit eaelum. It is the innermost fiery circle surrounding
the dark globe of the earth which is divine according to P. Probably C.
in his haste confused this with the ninth all-embracing sphere of the
Somn. Scip. 4 summus ipse dm, arcem ec continens ceteros, in quo infixi
amu 2222· qui volmmcur stellarum cursus campita-ni. In Ac. 11 118 we read
that P.'s first principle was ignem qui moveat terram quae ab eo somnetur,
which agrees fairly with Theophrastus quoted in Zeller⁴ 1 p. 522 δύο ποιεῖ
τὰς ἀρχάς πῦρ καὶ γῆν, τὸ μὲν ὥς ὕλην, τὸ δὲ ὥς αἴτιον καὶ ποιοῦν. Coloten,
one of the leading disciples of Epic„ wrote against Parm. as we learn from
Plut. M. p. 1113 foll, but there is no resemblance between the criticisms
which we find there, and those contained in this passage.

nam ε see n. on ξ 27.

commenticium ε see ξ 18. It suggests the more fanciful character of
the tenets here discussed in contrast to the preceding. For efficit we
should rather have expected effinqit, unless we retain the old reading sime}
litudine (pleferned by Sch. Opusc. 111 360) in the sense ‘ he makes out a
fanciful sort of thing by-the help of the similitude of a. crown'2

continente—orbem 2 ‘a shining ring of unbroken fire', i. e. not oom-
posite.

qui cingat. The later editors have followed Ernesti and Heind. in
reading cinqac required by the or. obl. instead of the cingit of the uss,
Sch. Opuac. 111 307 gives many exx. of the interchange of the moods in use.

in quo—potest. Epicurean polemio: this offends against our assump-
tion as to the human form of the Gods and the impossibility of sensation
except through the medium of bodily senses.

multaque-monstra : modi is inserwd after q‘mdem by most edd. and
no doubt the omission would be easy before nwmtra, which in that case
would be the Acc. governed by‘effioit. The monstra however which follow
(bellum, διο.) are hardly ejmdmn qaum-iu with the στεφάνη; 'and the recur-
rence of the phrase immediately below inclines me to adhere to the uss,
&uadem will then refer to P. and form part of a new sentence, of which
.momtrawillbethesubject. Onporteutacf.§18n.

quippe ‹mi—delentur. This is distinctly stated with regard to cupi-
ditas by Aristotle Met. 1 4, where he says that some approach to the
recognition of a final cause was made by those who assigned as a first
principle ἔρωτα ἦ ἐπιθυμίαν, οἷον καὶ Π. from whose poem περὶ φύσεως
he then quotes the line πρότιστον μὲν Ἔρωτα θεῶν μητίσατο πάντων.
