σελήνην, ἥλιον, τοὺς ἀστέρας καὶ τὸν οὐρανὸν ὅλον, Arist. An. 1 2. 17. As
¹ usual the criticiem consiste merely in the assertion of the irreconcileability
of the doctrine criticized with the Epicurean assumptione. Epic. held* that
the stare and the eoul were compounded of atoms and therefore dissoluble3
Alc. held that they possessed the property of sels-movement and were
therefore immortal-

1 think it ie a mistake in Shilleto (Thuc. 1 25) to endeavour to explain thie
use both in mm and γάρ by resen-ing to a supposed earlier meaning of the
two words—mm, he says, ie nearly equivalent to the German ηαηιίΐοΙι-
for, whatever may have been the original meaning, the word ie coloured by
ite preponderating use, which gives it its special eprightliness as a particle
of transition.

ἐστιν. This le the exoteric eide of the Pythagorean doctrine modified, ae ie
probable, by some Stoic commentator who wished to claim the authority
of P. for hie own pantheistic system. The statement in the Ac. 11 118

more in accordance with Arist. (Met. 1 ὅ, nv 3, δια), who also gives a

Plato Phaedo 85), ‘some call the soul a harmony, some eay that it con·
