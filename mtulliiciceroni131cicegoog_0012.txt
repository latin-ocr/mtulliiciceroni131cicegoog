πάντων. Every particle of matter is in continual movement. All
things are in flux like the waters of a river. One thing alone is per·
manent, the universal law which reveals itself in this movement.
This is Zeus, the all-pervading reason of the world. It is only the
illusion of the senses which makes us fancy that there are such things
as permanent substances. Fire exhibite most clearly the incessant
movement and activity of the world: confined in the body it con-
stitutes the human soul, in the universe at large it is God (the
substance and the process being thus identified).

Heraclitus is the first philosopher of whom we read that he
referred to the doctrines of other philosophers. He is said to have
spoken highly of some of the seven Wise Men, but condemned
severely Pythagoras and Xenophanes as well as the poete Hesiod‚
Homer and Archilochus. Though I agree with 'Ueberweg in classing
him with the older Ionics, yet his philosophy was no doubt largely
developed with a reference to the rival schools of Italy.

In the N. D. allusion is twice made to the obscurity of
Heraclitus (Ι 74, 111 35), but he does not appear in the catalogue of
philosophers criticized by Velleius, and this though Philodemus had
certainly treated of him, as we may see from the allusions in the
Fragments (Gompertz, pp. 70, 81). The reason for this omission is
probably that, his philosophy having been incorporated into the Stoic
system, it was unnecessary to discuss it separately. See Hirzel,
p. Ἀβαίζ, and N. D. 111 35, 1 74.

We must now cross the water with Pythagoras of Samos, born
582 Β.ο., who settled at Crotona in Italy, 529 Β.ο., and there founded
what is known as the Italic school. He seems to have found in the
mysteries and in the Orphic hymns the starting point which Thales
had discovered in Homer; and there can be little doubt that his
doctrine and system were also in part suggested by his travels in
Egypt. He established a sort of religious brotherhood with strict
rules and a severe initiation‚ insisted on training in gymnastics,
mathematics and music, and taught the doctrines of immortality and
of the transmigration of souls‚ and the duty of abstaining from animal
food. He is said to have committed nothing to writing himself,
but his doctrines were religiously guarded by his disciples (cf. N. D.
1 10), and recorded by Archytas and Philolaus, the latter a con-
temporary of Socrates.
