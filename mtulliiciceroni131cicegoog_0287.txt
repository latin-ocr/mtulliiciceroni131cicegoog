BOOK 1 cn. xxm ξ 108. 215

inculcatis: ‘you cram these images into our minds as well as into our
eyes ’‚ cf. Fac. 6 quid attinet inculeare satum, eum sine sato ratio omnium
rerum ad naturam fortunamve referatur f Cotta in his jaunty way treats
this quite as a new idea, but it has been assumed throughout the discus-
sion ; cf. ξ 106 interita mens, ad οοφῖαιίοηεηι, adventum in animos,pellamur
cmimidm. Itisoneof the many marksofhastewhichdisfigurethe book.
impunitas mnudi: ⁸ so little you care what you say '.

ch. xxm ξ 109. quam licenter: ‘what extravagance it is i’ cf. ξ 65.

fluentium—videatur τ cf. ξ 49, Lucr. 1v 228 nec mora ‘nec requies imer-
datur nlla fluendi, Epic. ap. Diog. L. x 48 ῥεῦσις ἀπὸ τᾶν σωμάτων τῆς
ἐπιπολῆς συνεχὴς συμβαίνει.

visionum: here=ima9inum the thing seen (as in Div. 11 120 animos
mm et αᾱνοηιίοἰα vicione pulsari), in ξ 105 the process of seeing.

dicere non intellegere: for the omission of the subject cf. ξ 84 coezficeri
nemra.

quo modo aeternae: the omission of eunt makes the change of oon-
struction nnusually harah.

suppeditat : ‘there is an endless supply of atoms ’.

inquit : ⁴ quotha ’, this reading is better supported than inqm‘s. Bentley,
on Hor. Sat. 1 4. 79 (cited by Creuzer on N. D. 1 100), compares the use of
φησί, and says perpetua formula eet, ubi aliquid av adm-eo nobie οῖῃῖοἰ et
opponi fraqima-3, sive id ab uno seu pluribus, sive ab ahsente eeu praesente
fiac, adding many exx.

num—sempiterna: ‘ do you mean to say then that everything will be
etei-nal for the same reason Ἰ ’ The infinity of the atoms is given by Veli.
1. c. as an explanation of the continuous stream of ime-ges, and apparently
as suggesting the eternity of the Being revealed to us in them 3 so Philod.
p. 110 ‘ the divine individuality (ἰδιότης) having its origin in the resem-
blance of the images may exist in perfect blessedness for ever'. Sch.
denies this, and says that the Epicurean argument for the eternity of the
Gods is (l) the πρόληψις (2) ἰσονομία. But the πρόληψις is simply the
unconscious effect of experience, i. e. of the impression of the images on the
mind, and ἰσονομία is mentioned in ξ 50 as the ground of the infinite
number, not of the infinite duration, of Mmortal beings. Itis probable
however, as stated m the note there, that O. has wrongly spoken of beings
instead of forces, and we may therefore allow ἰσονομία to stand as one of
the arguments. A third argument (denied by Sch. ) was the fineness of the
atoms of which the Gods were composed, see ξ 71 n.

aequilibritatem: of. ξ 5ος the word appears to be ὄπ. hey. though
Vitruvius uses aequdibnh.

isto modo—sint aliqui immortales : ‘according to that, since men
are mortal, some would be immortal ². Sin: is the apodosis to a protasis

contained in isto modo-2⁸2· lwc ita sit.

* et quia sunt—sentio: ‘and since there are destructive forces, *there
are also (or reading sim with some of the best uss„ ‘let there be also')
