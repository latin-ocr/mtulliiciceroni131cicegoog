good and powerful God. When Seneca says deos nemo sanus timet (Benq‘.
1v 19) it is not from any notion of the Gods being indifferent to the actions
of men, but he is simply asserting the Platonic doctrine that God never
harms any (nep. 11 379 folL), that His acting is always for the best both to
the universe at large and to each individual in it. In Philod. p. 94 we read
that it was charged against the Epicuream, that their doctrine deprived good
men of their religione hopes, προσεπιφέρουσιν δὲ καὶ διότι τῶν ἀγαθῶν καὶ
δικαίων παραιρούμεθα τὰς καλὰς ἐλπίδας ἂς ἐν τοῖς θεοῖς ἔχουσι, to which it is
replied p. 97 that the vulgar ideas of reward and punishment are aban-
doned by all philosophers, and that many go so far as to deny them any
power to hurt, οὐδεὶς γὰρ ὥς εἰπεῖν τῶν ὠφελεῖν καὶ βλάπτειν εἷρηκότων φιλον-
σόφων τοὺς θεούς, ὁμοίας τοῖς χυδαίοις (the vulgar) ὑπέλιπεν τὰς ὠφελίας καὶ
τὰς βλάβας, πολλοὶ δ’ οὐδὲ βλάπτειν ὅλως ἔφασαν αὖτούς, but the true and
just are rewarded as Polyaenus has stated in his 1st book z p. 100 ὠφελίας
ἐκ θεῶν τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς καὶ βλάβας τοῖς κακοῖς καταλείπουσι (i. e. apparently the
Epicureans): Ρ. 124 καὶ σωτηρίας ἀνθρώποις διὰ τοῦ θεοῦ καταληπτέον ὑπο-
γράφει (i.e. Epicurus) διὰ πλειόνων, ἐν δὲ τῷ τρισκαιδεκάτῳ περὶ τῆς οῖκειότη·
τος ἢν πρός τινας o‘ θεὸς ἔχει καὶ τῆς ἀλλοτριότητος z p. 125 ‘with the favour
of heaven (θεαῖν ἵλεον ὄντων) we need not sear war, with the favour of
heaven we shall pass our lives in purity ἐ ΡΡ. 86-89 ‘ the Stoice deny that
the Gods are the authors of evil to men and thus take away all restraint on
iniquity and degrade men to the level of the brutes (for who would be
balked of the injustice for which he crevens, from the sear of air or‘aether 2),
while we say that punishment comes to some from the Gods, and the
greatest of good to others': also p. 145. It is difficult to see how this
approach to the common opinion (which goes much beyond what Lucr.
allows vl 70) can be reconciled with other positive statements of Epicurus
or with his general principles as given in the text. See the Academic‚
or rather Stoic, criticism in § 121. For the form of expression (nec habere
ipsum nec exhibere alteri) we may compare St James 1 13 ὁ γαρ θεὸς ἄπει-
ραστός ε’στι κακῶν, πειράζει δὲ αὐτὸς οὐδένα, Plut. Mor. 1102 Ε καὶ φαῦλον
οὐδὲν ποιεῖν αὐτῷ θέμις, ὥσπερ οὐδὲ πάσχειν, Sen- De Ira 11 27 natura illis
(dis) mita} et placida est, tam longe remota ab aliena injuria quam a sua.

sit—essent—-essentt the Pres. Subj. is allowable because it is a general
proposition having no more reference to the past than to the present ε the
Imperf. is afterwards used in order to remind the reader that this is a
statement made in the past by Epic„ not necessarily adopted by the writer;
see Draeger ξ 131, and (on the mixed construction) ξ 124 Β c, where it is
pointed out that when there are two subordinate clauses, standing in
different degrees of subordination, the more remote subordination is fre-
quently expressed by the Imperf. the less remote by the Pres. Subj. Com-
pare for the corresponding use of the Subj. and Opt. in Greek, Je1f§ 809,
