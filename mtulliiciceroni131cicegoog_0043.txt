sotmcns os BOOK 1. xliii

tained in the first book of the N. D. I will begin with giving a
short account of this treatise‚ proceeding then to point out the more

striking resemblances between it and the present work, and will
finally examine more in detail the relations of the two to each other.

In the year 1752 great curiosity was excited by the discovery of
a library at Herculaneum in the house which 1188 been called after

Piso the father-in-law of Caesar ¹, from the fact that ‘its site agrees
with Oicero’s statement that the residence of the Pisos was visible

from his own villa at Puteoli’ (Hayter's Report on bke Herculaneum
MSS, London 1811, p. 31) 3 and also from the fact that most of the
1188 found there contained treatises by writers belonging to the
Epicurean school, of which Piso was an adherent, and that many of
them bore the name οἱ Philodemus, who is known (from Cicero’s
speech in Pisonem) to have been the intimate friend and instructor
of Piso. The difficulty of unrolling the chari-ed papyri was very
great, and it was not till the year 1793 that the lst Vol. of
Hmulammia (containing the treatise of Philodemus περὶ μουσικῆς)

x appeared at Naples. At the instigation οἱ the English Ambassador,

Sir W. Hamilton, the Prince of Wales undertook to supply the
'necessary funds for carrying on the work more actively, and also
sent 1118 librarian, ' the Rev. John Hayter, to assist in opening and
copying the 1883 in which he succeeded so well that, in the four
years from 1802 10 1806, 01010 than 200 were unrolled. In the
latter year the work had to be abandoned in consequence of the
French occupation of Naples, but copies of 94 usS, after remaining
for a while at Palermo, were ultimately sent to England and pre-
sented to the Bodleian together with four unopened papyri’3 and in

maintains that two of the busta found there represent Piso and his colleague
Gabinius; and certainly they agree remarkably well with Cicero' s description of
the pair in his speech Pro Sext. 18.

the Epicurean argument in Cicero.
