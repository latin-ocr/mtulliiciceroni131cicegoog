8 of the ἀπόρρητα of Cam, also nv 6, Sext. Emp. P. H. 1 234, Diog. L. 1v 33,
August. Ep. 1185 16. This notion of Academic mysteries was no doubt
fostered by Plato’s half jocular use of the words ἀπόρρητα (Phaedo 62 Β),
ἀμύητοι, μυστήρια (leeaet. 155> n). J. S. R. See also Lobeck Ayl. p.
127 folL] According to Augustino (Ac. 111 41) Metrodorus of· Stratonice
asserted that the Academics used their negative doctrine (ailad percipi)
merely as a weapon against the Stoice, and Aug. believes that they still
held, as an esoteric doctrine, all that Plato had taught about the ideal
world, in which exists the real truth of which the shadow alone, the veri
simile, is to be found on earth (A c. 111 37 seq.). Though Ο. professes here
to practise the same reserve, he states his views plainly in his Aristotelian
dialogues3 and even in the Heraclidian dialogues like the present (see n. on
Heraclides ξ 34) he lets it be seen to which side he thinks the probability
inclines (see 111 95). However it must be owned that he succeeded in
mystifying Abp. Whately in regard to his belief on such an important
matter as the immortality of the soul, (see W.'s Euays on Peoeaiariaeioe ⁰f
tloe Christian Reliqion, App. B. on C‘ioero).

ξ 12 nihil—sequantur: ‘ nothing to guido them ’. The word occurs
constantly in the Academica (alluded to just below as alio loco) in this
sense, eg. 11 8, 24, 33, 36, 99, διο. The Academics maintained in opposition
to the Stoice that we can do very well without absolute certainty, in Bp
Butler's words that ‘ probability is the (only and the sufficient) guide of
lii'e ’. In the previous sentence we have secutum used in another sense
‘ aimed at ’. For similar careless repetitions see ξ 13 inventus—inmte,
