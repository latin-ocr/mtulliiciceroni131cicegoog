ξ 19. quibus enim. oculis· The reading animi after oculis is doubt-
„less a gloss intended to be an answer to the question in the text3 solt,
who retains it, translates ‘mit was fflr Geistesaugen’, but such a guarded
complex phrase would be inconsistent with the form of the question,
quibus implying‚ like the Gr. ποίοις, a palpable absurdity. It could
only have been used if an objector in reply to the simple question ‘with
what eyes could he have seen it‘e’ had already answered ‘the eyes of the
mind '. Then the latter phrase might have been attacked as itself in-
001131υοαῆ ποίοις ψυχῆς ὅμμασινς but Vell. is made far too simple-minded
to guard himself beforehand against any such answer. On the correctneae
of the phrase oculis animi instead of oc. mentis, see Sch. and Heidtmann
p. 31, Klotz Adm. Gr. 11 3, Wytt. on Plut. Num. Vind. p. 94. 111 Rep.

fabricam tanti operis qua construi mundum facit: ‘ the construc-
tion of so vast a work, 1 mean the putting together and building up of the
world in the ways which 116 describes ’. The relative clause serves rather
awkwardly to explain what is meant by tanti operis. The construction
fabrica qua construitur, instead of s. construendi, may beillustrated bytho
sentence in which Vitruvius defines the term (1 1-), Fabrica est omatinaata
et trita aaa meditatio, qua manibus perficitur e materia anius cujusque
generis opus, et ad propositum deformationis. The word fabrica is used in
the N. D. (a) for the workshop or forge (111 55), Vulcanus lemni fabricae
traditur praesuzkae5 (b) for the working or art itself, 11 150 the fingere are
useful ad omnem fabricam aeri-3 et sem-i ‘for every kind of working in iron
or brass’, 11 35 utpictura et fabrica ceteraeque arte-3 liabent quendamabeo-
luti operi-5 effectum ‘as in painting and architecture we look to the general
effect', (so more generally 11 138 incredibilis fabrica naturae and Div. 1 116
fabrica consectionis ‘the art of oleaving wood’, used much as it is here);
(c) for the completed work, 11 121 motata diem'ptio partium, admirabilis
fabrica membrorum ‘structure ’. In this passage it has a sneering force
(like H. Spenoer’s ‘carpenter-theory of creation’ Γένει Principia p. 120) as
in §53 natura effectum cue mundum, nihil opus faisse fabrioa, and Ac. 11

ξ 4 fabricati. If the elaborate constructive processes of the Timaeus had
been meant to be taken literally, the Epicureans would have had some
ground for objecting to their anthropomorphic character, but there can
be little doubt that they are figurative like the myths in the Gor-,qim and
