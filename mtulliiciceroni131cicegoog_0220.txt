impression of a human form. Such a description suits fiairly with the
account given 01· Democritus’ theology (N. D. 1 120) according to which the
Gods 010 nothing more than combinatione of ethereal atoms floating about
00 imaginem but it is difficult to see how it could be reconciled with
the ordinary account of Epicurus' innumerable Gods of the intermundta,
far removed from the sphere of those atomio storms which are ever making
and unmaking the surrounding worlds. 11· the zmayines which appear to men
are composed of atoms thrown off from the Gods of the imm-mundio, why
may not atoms find their way back again from our world to them, 00 in
fact is asserted by Cotta § 1142 How 000 beings which have no solidita
be continually throwing off those myriads of atoms of which the images
are formed, especially when we consider the vast distance of the inta-
mtmdia from the earth, and reflect that, radiation being equal in all
directions, there must be the same crowding of divine images at every
point 01· this immense circumference‘l Again‚ if the Gods have no separate
individuality, how are they capable of conversing together and exhibiting

numerical identity, but 00 they meditate on the impressione which they

features of the judge, the ruler, the father. Some such idealistio interpre-
