suit the context. what is wanted is 8 phrase to express strict logical
procedure as opposed to 8 mere statement of belief, end I think this
is better expressed by the Abl. than by Sch.’s argumenta (or summam)
manlieu, see his Opusc. 111 289 and 328. Madv„ it is true, denies the
possibility ofthis reading, see his note on AE‘n. 1 aomina ‘rationem arqu-
mmmm cortcluderc’ dicimur, etiam ‘aliquid covwluderc’ ut accusativus pro-
nomim‘c addamn- ‘sententiam rcm’ non magis ‘concludere' dioimw quam
‘rem περανῶ am ‘veritatem κί’. But negative statements of this kind are
to be received with very great suspicion even when made about the writer's
own lsnguage, and the correctness of the expression is, Ι think, shown by
the citatione in Mulier Aaou Or. v, e.g. Ac. 1 32 itaque tradebatu- omnis dia-
tomum disciplina, id est, orationis racione emolu-sae, which Reid translates
‘ speech drawn up in sylloffstic form '3 cf. too Diu. 1 82 quam (divina-
tionem) cccc re vera hac Stoicorum ratimw concluditur, where we might
sinely have had quac sommia rat. concluditur. The phrase occurs in the
more general sense of ‘rounding off’ in Brutus 34 ipsa natura cab-cum-
scriptione quadam verborum cvarehcndz't concluditque mumuian„ Omtor

ch. xxxn. beatos esse—hominis figura. This is an example of the
composite or chain syllogism (see Hamilton Loqio 1 pp. aee—385), also
called the ‘ sorites ’‚ though that term is confined to the synonymous
sophism by C., unless we except the doubtful passage in Ru. rv 50. The
simple syllogisms of which the sorites is composed are as follows, (1) All
that are blessed are virtuous, the gods are blessed, therefore the gods are
virtuous; (2) all that are virtuous are rational, the gods are vii-tuens,
therefore rational3 (3) 811 that are rational ere in the shspe of man, the
gods are rational, therefore in human shepe-

quem-daturum. The Epicureans no doubt would answer, not per-

haps with the French materialist, that thought was s. secretiori of the
human brein, but that expericnce told us nothing of the operations of
reason except as contained in 8 human body; and so in fact we find it
stated in a Herculanean treatise, quoted on ξ 48.

sumpsisses tuo jure ε Madvig on Pin. 11 35 gives this as an example of
the jussive use of the Subj„ on which see Roby ξ 1604 and my n. on
deduces 111 76. Thus taken it would mean, ‘if reason were confined to
· human shape, you should have assumed the doctrine of anthropomorphism
on your own authority' (without 811 this reasoning). Otherwise we might
take it as an ordinary apodosis efter εἰ ica met, ‘you would have been
justified in assuming it ’. Sch. suggests that it is equivalent either to
debebas or to poteras eumer-c. The second no doubt gives the most natural
sense, ‘ you might have assumed it on your own authority, without ssking
