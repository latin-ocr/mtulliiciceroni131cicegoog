(6) Ιο regard to nouns bon-owed from the Greek Ι have followed
Madvig’s rule (Gram. 5 33 obs. 3), ‘ Where both forms are in use, it
is better to adhere to the Latin’, in accordance with the principles
laid down by Quintilian 1 5 5 63 and Cicero Aa. vl 9, (see the

quota-tiens in Roby ᾖ 471, 482). Thus Ι have always used the '

termination -em for the Ace. of Greek nouus in -es, whereas Miiller
writes, at one time, Socraten (1 93), Timocraten (1 93), Simoniden
(1 60), Nausiphanen (1 93), Cleanthen (111 5), but more generally
Socratem (1 31), Timocratem (1 113), Simonidem (Div. 1 56), Empe·
doclem, Aristotelem, Ganymedem, Archimedem, Euphratem, X ono-
phanem dte. So I have written ibim, Apim in 1 82, where Muller
has Apim but ibin .· 1 have uniformly written Zeno, but in 5 70 ΜίίΠοι·

gives Zenon.

(7) Ι have always written di in the Nom. and dio in the Abl.;
Muller uses di or dei, dis or deis indiscriminately.

(8) Ι have written Lyceo in ἓ 7 2 where Muller has Lycio, but in
Div. 1. 8 and 22 he gives the spellings Lyceum, Lyceo. Where he
writes oportuno 5 15, oportunitas ἓ 92¹, benivolentia ἓ 58, Xerses
,5 115, Arqia 5 82, Ι have written with Baiter opportune, opportunitas,
benevolentia, Xerxes, Aryiva. In one instance, incolw, I have pre-
ferred the less usual spelling to the ordinary inchoo (which Mssller
keeps) not merely on the ground that it has most authority in its
favour, but because it is the more rational, as showing better the
etymology and probably also the pronunciation.

Thus far I have not departed much from the prevalent usage
in the latest editions. I have now to plead guilty ιο two heresies.
The first is that' I have used the character J for the consonante-l I.
My reasons for doing so are as follows: (1) the use of J, to dis-
tinguish the consonant from the vowel I, seems to me ιο stand on
the same footing with the use of V to distinguish the consonant
from the vowel U. N either use was known to the ancients, but
convenience has led most editors to preserve the distinctiva V,
indeed Madvig, who had dropped it in his first edition of the
De Finibus, returned ιο it in the later editions3 and all who write
on the phonetics of Latin are compelled to mend the unscientific =
orthography of the Romans by treating the J and V as distinct
letters known by distinctive characters. (2) It might perhaps be
