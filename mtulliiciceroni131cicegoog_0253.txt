Δ homo nemo: ‘ no one who is a man ', not simply=nemo or nullus homo.

ξ 79. et quidem: ‘ yes, and ant like ant ². This formula is often used
to express an ironical acceptanoe of an opponent's argument, professing to
carry it further but really showing that it is applicable in an opposite sense
to that intended by the user; cf. Div. 11 114 (in answer to an argument for
divination) nonne ea praedixit quae facta emit? Ille vero; et ea quidem
quae omme tinoebamue ,· N. D. 1 100 (against the argument for anthropomor-
p'hism from innate ideas) habebam informationem quandam dei. Et barbati

pediency) torquem detra-vit hosti. Et quidem se texit, m interiret, (see
Madv. in loc. and Emmd. p. 90 folL, Moser on Tuae. 111 48, Draeg. ξ 311
13). It is used to emphasize without irony in §§ 55, 59, 82 et quidem alia,
83 et quidem laudamus, 89 et libenter quidem. The ironicel meaning is
also found in quidem alone, as 111 82 ac Phalarin, at Apollodorus poenas

formica: allusion is again made to the ant in 11 158, 111 21 3 similarly
Celsus αφ. Orig. compares it with man as affording an instance of civil life
(Π 77, 81), and of foresight (ib. 83), and argues that in the sight of God
the two must be much on a level (ib. 85). ·

quot-us quisquo. As ter-tim q., quartus q. mean ‘each third ³, ‘ each
fourth man’, so q. q. means strictly ‘each how-many-etk’, Le. ‘one out of
how large a number’, ‘what a small fraction'.

Athenis cum essem: probably referring to 79 Β.ο., when O. attended
lecturos there in company with Atticus and other friends3 so in ξ 59 and
ξ 93 he ascribes his own experience to Cotta.

ο aeribus—singuli: ‘searce one in each company' (the σύστρεμμα
numbering about 15 privates, see Dumont Εεεαί sm· Z’Eploe'bie Attz’que), so
Tae v 77 adulemntium qreyee Lacedaemone vidimiae ipsi ›ineo-edibili comen-
tione oet-cantes. An Athenian was strictly ἔφηβος from the age of 18 to 20,
during which time he had to serve as περίπολος, but the term was loosely
used of youths aster 16, when they commenced their regular training in
the gymnasia. Hermann Gr. Alc. 1 ξ 176 speaks of the increased import-
anoe attached to the organization of the Ephebi after the loss of liberty
and under the Roman power. The Latinized form is freely used by Varro
and the comic poete. Grex here just corresponds to the Cretan ἀγέλης it
is technieally used of a company of actore.

arriserint ‘you smile at the confession of my weakness’.

concedentibus—delectamur. Compare the partly ironical and playful
professione of admiration which abeund in the Platonic dialognes, e. g.
Oliarm. p. 154 ο, Lysi-3 204 Β; and see Thompson's Phaednoe App. 1, Zeller
