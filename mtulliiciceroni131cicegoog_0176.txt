existent, incorporeal mind ¹, whereas Epicurus of course preferred the other
alternative and proclaimed the priority of matter. But the form given to
the doctrine of Thales in the preceding sentence would not be inconsistent
with a pure idealism3 indeed Minucius c. 19, quoting this passage says
that Τ. copied the Mosaic account of the Spirit of God moving upon the
face of the waters. We may therefore conclude that this form is due to
O. himself² and that the author whom he follows could have said nothing of
‘mind making all things out of water'3 but only described in general terms
the combination of two principles. The use of the plural di after the sing.
dem may be intended to heighten the supposed absurdity of the dogma, or
it may be an allusion to the words already quoted πάντα πλήρη θεῶν.
Another way of dealing with the sentence is to regard ei ipae—tempore as
an example of repeated protasis: so Heind.‚ Moser, Krische, Kiihner. As
the repetition of the protasis would be only admissible here, if the 2nd
protasis were really a restatement of the let, (see Madv. Fin. 1 7, who calls
this passage ,φανεῖεν mendosus) we should then have to take nien-5 as ex·
plaining di, and sine conpore as explaining eine censu, interpreting as fol·
lows, ‘if the gods, i.e. pure mind, can exist spart from feeling, i.e. from a
human body (we must take corpus thus if it is essential to sensatim, for
body in the wide sense, including the elements, is sine amu ,· see below on
Empedocles and Diogenes) why did he add mind to waterl' But it is plain
that there is no logical connexion here between protasis and apodosis.
Nor is anything gained by reading motu for mem with Moser, Krische,
Kiihner. Kr. defends the change by a reference to the polemio against
Anaxagoras just below, and to a passage in Philodemus p. 88 1. 30, where
allusion is made to philosophers who deify τοὺς οὐδ’ ἐπικινηθῆναι δυναμέναις
ἢ τοὺς ἐναργῶς ἀναισθήτουςς and explains aa follows ‘if it is possible for
gods to exist without feeling or movement, i.e. as pure incorporeal spirit,
why did he link them to water, if mind can exist apart from body', an in·
terpretation which is open to the same charge as Heindorf's.

Lastly it may be worth mention that three of the best uss read εἰσ for
εἰ, on which Davies followed by Allen founds the text, sic di possum esee

εἰπε mma. At mentem cur aquae, δια, and similarly Becker Comm- Gn’t.
p. 14 sic ‹ii-semul aed mentem—comm! Krische points out the ob-
jections to this. See for a discussion of the whole passage his Theol-
Lekren pp. 34—42, and Sch. Opmc. 111 359. Other suggestions are given

count of his doctrine in Ac. 11 118 infinitatem naturae dixit esee a qua
cuncta qiqnerentur. If there were any consistency in the Epicurean
polemio, A’s first principle τὸ ἄπειρον (like the Water of‘Thales) should

chaotic matter, as Plato, but of the universe itself‚ still he constantly affirm·
