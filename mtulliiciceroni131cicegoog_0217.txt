translation of the Greek ταύτὸν κατ’ ἆριθμόν διαμένει ⁴ remains numefieally

Whately’s loqio App. (on the ambiguity of the word ‘same’). But will κατ’
ἆριθμόν carry this meaning by itselfi For proof of this Hirzel refers to
Bonitz’s Index Aristotelicas s. v. ἀριθμός, see particularly Anal. Post. 1 c. 5,
p. 74 where the phrase κατ’ ἀριθμόν is uoed of argument which applies only
to a single individual triangle, as opposed ιο ‘proper geometrical reasoning

cate, it seems hardly credible that he should, without remark, have
supplied the interpretation afterwards through the mouth of the Academici
critic. I believe therefore that eadem has been lost between neque and ad, ‘'

the end of the paragraph the question, how we are ιο conceive of Gods not
possessed of personal identity or individual existence ¹. [Soliditace cannot
possibly be an abl. of quality. Soliditate quadam might be taken as such
with esse or a substantive, but not with a verb like cernatur. Why not
treet it as abl. of cause, (cf. ξ 105 similitudine cernatur) tianslating ‘so that
it is not perceived by sense or by mind, nor in consequence of any sort of
solidity which it possessas, nor numerically, i.e. individually’? A causal
abl. gives indirectly what is wanwd, a description of the object which
is the source of the cause. R]
