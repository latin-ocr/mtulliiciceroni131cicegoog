is said (Draeg. ξ 413) to be found only in Cic. Suet. and Gen„ but Auen

by Sert. Emp. Mada. 11 51 fon. in a list of atheistical philosophas, but he
adds Prodicus, Euhemerus and Critias, all of whom are introduced, the last
without name, by C. in ξ 117 fon. where see nn. Fabricius in his note on
Sext. l. c. mentions several other philosophers against whom the same
charge was brought. Clem. Al. Protr. 2 p. 7 Sylb. gives s similar list, but
will not allow the justice of the charge. ‘the true ἄθεοι are not those who
deny false gods, but those who deny the true and worship the false'. This
is a retort upon the heathem whose name for the Christians was ἄθεοι, but
Clemens fails to distinguish between the denial of what was false in the
heathen religions‚ and the denial of religion m itself. There can be little

doubt thalt m some cases, eg. that of Theodorus, the denial was of the
latter kin

Lupus: Horace (Sat. 11 1. 68) and Persius (1 114) also speak of a
Lupus satirized by Lucilius. He is generally supposed to be L. Cornelius
Lentulus Lupus, Aedile Ec. 163, Consul 156, Censor 147, but Mum-o has
shown that this can hardly be the csse (Journal qf. Philoloqy vol. vm

p. 217). In the first book of his Satires Luc. made the Gods hold a
council concerning his death, Serv. ad Aen. x 104.
