Ch. 1111. Simonides: the lyric poet of Ceos, no. 550-470, one of the
illustrious circle (including Pindar, Epicharmus, Aeschylus) whom Hiero
tyrant of Syracuse (d. 467 nc.) attracted to his court. In Xenophon’s Hieron
Sim. is introduced as conversing with Η. on the advantages and disadvan-
tages of tyranny. Some of his gnomic sayings are discussed in Plato’s dia-
logues, e. g Protaq. 3393, Rep. 1 331 n. Minucius (c. 13) reports the story
correctly, but Tertullian carelessly assigns the words ιο Thales in answer

father’s character, but he is not thereby precluded from trusting and loving
him as faithful and good. The opposite view leaves men helpless victims
