exposition which had been already dealt with by Cotta. His allu-
sions to the remainder of the speech of Velleius are very scanty
(11 47 and 7 3). On the whole Ι think the framework of the book
requires some such review of previous philosophers to justify the
frequent references to the diversity of opinion on the subject of theo-
logy, ag. in ἓ 1 and ἓ 13 ponam im medio effluentiae philosophorum,
and then si commiserint omnes, in ᾖ 14 doctissimorum homimum tanta
dissensio,· in ἓ 42 &posui non philosopher-mn judicia, sed delirantium
somnia, compared with ἓ 94 3 expressions which would, 1 think, be
less appropriate, if Cicero confined himself strictly to the three schools
represented by the disputante. The repetitions complained of are
scarcely to be called repetitions, for they leave out the main point
in the previous argument against Plato and the Stoica, viz. the ques-
tion as to a creation in time 3 but as far as they are such, they may
be explained by the haste and carelessness which characterize the
whole treatise, and of which we shall see instances in the latter half
of the lst book ; the special difficulty of ἓ 25 is, I think, removed by
the explanation given in my note.

There is one other point which is likely to strike the reader, and
which calls for a few remarks, and that is the inferiority of the his-
torical section to the other two, In the lst section there is the usual
Epicurean arrogance of manner, but the objections stated are in
themselves of interest and importance 3 and so as regards the argu-
ments of the 3rd section3 but in the 2nd section we meet with little
besides misrepresentation and abuse. Is this a mark of a different
authority having been used, or has G. wished to g1ve us a sample of
the way in which Epicuream, such as Colotes, composed their his-
tories of philosophy, and at the same time to illustrate the charge he
has himself brought against the Epicureans, vestra solum Ζερίιίε,
ceteros cauea incognita condemnatis, MD. 11 732

What then is the general conclusion to which we are led by this
comperison of the two treatises'l The impression left upon my
own mind is that as far as the historica] section extends cer-
tainly, and possibly for the expository section als0, both have copied
a common original, most likely Zeno, the teacher of both Philodemus
and Cicer-03 whom Cotta calls the spokesman (coryplzaem) of the
school, and of whom he makes the suggestive remark, that he at-
tended his lectures at the request of Philo the Academician, in order
that he might the better understand how well the latter had suc-
ceeded in refutiug him, while he also compares his style of arguing to
