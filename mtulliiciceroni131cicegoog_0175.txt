fine atoms which form the soul and especially its purest part, the mind or
reason, which has its seat in the heart, ‘(l.c. 66) are the true source of
sensation, but that they can only act when confined within the body, on
leaving which they are immediately dissipated and no longer erist as soul.

²- Body by itself, i.e. the compound of grosser atoms known to us by the

name of body, is incapable of sensatim, but when united with the finer
atoms of mind, it becomes sensitiva to a certain degree. On the general
subject of the relation of soul and body, cf. Lucr. 111 esp. 230—287, where
he shows that either by itself is alike incapable of sensation. Taking this as
our clue, Ι think the only satisfactory way of getting over the difficulties of
the sentence is to suppose that the apodosis to the 2nd protasis has been
lost. This was the view of Lambinus who inserted the clause cm· aquam
menti before aob‘mwit, changing ec niente into mentem. Most of the modern
editors have followed in the same track. The text which 1 have given is
that of Baiter except that 1 go with Lamb. in omitting et πωπω, which
seems to have arisen simply from a misreading of the abbreviated φωναὶ·
when this was once taken as an Abl. it would naturally be joined with the
preceding semu by an et. Sch's reading runs the first question too much
into the second; the first cur must certainly be followed by an achan-vit.-
and it is also easier to account for the loss of the 2nd clause, if its end was
an echo of the lst. How then will the argument stand? The dogma
attacked is, in its most general form, that the first principle is divinely
animated water ; to which it is objected that we have here an unneceoeary
combination of two principles: ‘if divinity is possible without feeling, why
add mind? Why may not simple water stand for the first principle ‘l On
the other haud, if mind is capable of existing alone, unconnected with any
body, why tie it down to water 2³ It is difficult to deal with the argument
from the ambiguity in the use of the word ‘god’. If by ‘god' is meant the
first principle, then the Epicureans would have allowed that this may
' exist rim serua. In their view senseless atoms are the first principle& and
they could have no a priori objection to senseless water holding the same
office. On the other hand, if the name ‘god' implies personality, then it is

plain that the first principle of Thales was not a god. Divine persons such ,

as those whom the popular religion recognized were as subordinate in his
philosophy as they were in that of Epicurus, but they are certainly not
more opposed to the former system than to the latter. The point of the
objection seems to be that a dynamical principle, like that of the older
Ionio philosophers, as opposed to the mechanical principles of Democritus,
is an irrational blending of two contrary principlea the materialistic and
the idealistic. In this objection Plato and Aristotle would concur, both
holding that the universe took shape under the influence of etei-nal, selfss
