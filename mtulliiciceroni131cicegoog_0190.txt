charge. The passage alluded to is v11 821, where ὁ Αθηναῖος, speaking the
author‘s sentimenta says ‘there‘is something very surprising in our notions
about astrorwmy, τὸν μέγιστον θεὸν καὶ ὅλον τὸν κόσμον φαμὲν οὔτε ζητεῖν
δεῖν οὔτε πολυπραγμονεῖν τὰς atriae ἐρευνῶντας· οὔ γὰρ οὐδ’ ὅσιον εἶναι, but
true piety requires just the opposite. We ought to carry our inquii-y into
the nature of the celestial deities (the Sun, Moon, &c.), at least so far as to
enable us to avoid such blasphemy as men are guilty of, when they call
them wandering stare, and confound the rates of their movements'. It 13
plain that the word φαμέν introduces, not a sentiment of Plato’ s, but that
of the Athenian public, who had banished Anaxagoras and put Socrates to
death on a similar charge. Plato' s own view comes out still more clearly
in bk 111 966, where he argues that astronomy rightly studied is the foun-
dation of true piety.

divinities owing their existence to the good pleasure of the one Father and
Creator. So we read (mm. 34) of the plan pursued by the everliving God
in forming the God who was to be (i. e. the world), and in p. 92 this created
God is called the visible image of the invisible God. The name οὐρανός 13
sometimes used of the κόσμος, at other times confined to the stan-y heavens
as opposed to the earth. Beside the passages already quoted, showing the
divinity of the stare, ,see Tim. 40, where the Demiurgus is said to have
made the earth, our nurse, the guardian of day and night, the first and
oldest of the gods ὅσοι ἐντὸς οὐρανοῦ γεγόνασι. 111 the same passage Plato
affirms 1113 belief m the deities of the traditional religion (eos quos majoram
instituta& acoepimus) the children of Heaven and Eat-th, and tells us that
they, like the celestial deities, acted as subordinate agents m the creation
of man and the other animals, receiving from the Demiurgus a separate
divine particle to be the nucleus of each human soul (41 ο. foll.) But
when C. says that Plato deified animos, he probably alludes to βαρ. 1.
892 foll. where it is proved that soul, as the sels-moving substance, must be
prior to body, and then (899 Β) the conclusion is drawn that, since soul or
souls have been shown to be the cause of all movement, and since they are
