nature than man, as most evidently those ἐξ 03» ὁ κόσμος συνέστηκεΐ, and
in Phys. 11 4 they are called τὰ θειότατα νῦν φανερῶν. Taking it thus as a
collective expression (simplex ea· dispersis membris as is said of Xenocrates)
we might find in it an explanation for tot di immediately below, but see 11.
there.

celeritate: ‘like a dancing dervish making himself giddy by his rota-
tions’ lescaloperius in loc. See on ξ 24.

ubi tot dl: Heind. (followed by Sch. Opusc. 111 311) thinks that, as tot
cannot apply to the four above mentioned (which in reality are only two, the

κινοῦν and κινούμενον), something must have been lost from the text 3 and
as Arist. is said non dissentire from his master, he suggests that the lost

clause may have corresponded with § 30 quos mqjorwm institutae accepimus. -

But why may we not give the same meaning to illi tot viz. ‘all those many
Gods of the popular religion'‚ without supposing an omission? (So Allen.)
The Epicurean objection would then be that ‘these gods are supposed to
exist in heaven, but if heaven itself is God, how can one god live in
another'l If we accept Sch’s conjecture that the lost clause referred to
the stara, the objection would merely be a repetition of eaelum mundi esee
panem: ‘they are already included in caelum, how can they be separate
and independent Gods'2

numeramus: similarly 111 40, 43.

semper se movens: these words are in direct opposition to Aristotle's
κινεῖ ἀκίνητος, which is further explained (Cael. 11 12) ἔοικε τῷ μὲν ἄριστα
ἔχοντι ὑπάρχειν τὸ εὖ ἄνευ πράξεως...ἔστι γὰρ αὐτῷ τὸ οὗ ἕνεκα. The Epi-
curean views of incorporeal substance (semu privat) have been sufficiently
illustrated already.

ξ 34 Xenocrates: cf. Krische 311-324 Ν. D. 1 72. C. alludes more than
once to the compliment paid to Xenocrates by his countrymen in accepting
his word in lieu of the customary cath Balb. 12, Act. 1 163 he reports his
answeras to the aim of his teaching, ut id saa sponte facerem quod coya-
rentursacere legibus Rep. 1 35 and describes his psychology in the words
animi fiquram et quasi tmpus negavit ease, verum numerum dixit eam cujus
vis, ut jam ante Pyckaqorae visum erat, in natura maxima esset. Tunc. 1 20.
The account given in the text omits all that is characteristic in his philo-
sophy: see Stob. Ed. 1 p. 62 Ξεν. τὴν μονάδα καὶ τὴν δυάδα θεοὺς (ἀπεφήνατο)
τὴν μὲν ὥς ἄρρενα πατρὸς ἔχουσαν τάξιν ἐν οὐρανῷ βασιλεύουσαν, ἥντινα
προσαγορεύει καὶ Ζῆνα καὶ πέρα-τον καὶ νοῦν, ὅστις ἐστὶν αὐτῷ πρῶτος θεός· τὴν
δι’ ὥς θηλεὶαν, μητρὸς θεῶν δίκην (Zeller notices that Philolaus also gave the
name of Rhea to the dyad) τῆς ὑπὸ τὸν οὐρανὸν λήξεως ἦγουμὲνην (‘preeid.ing
over the middle region or province’) θεὸν δὲ εἶναι καὶ τὸν οὐρανὸν, καὶ τοὺς,
ἀστέρας πυρώδεις Ὀλυμπίους θεούς, καὶ ἑτέρους ὑποσελήνους, δαίμονας ἀοράτους.
