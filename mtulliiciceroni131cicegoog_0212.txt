si nihil—erat dictum: ‘if we had had no other aim beyond that of
piety in worship and freedom from superstition, we might have ended
here’. OntheIndina ’see§l9lon9wnest,n.

cum aeterna esset: we need not (with Draeg. ξ 151. 3) explain the
Imperf. as attracted to the tense of the principal verb (coleretur). It ex-
prm a consideration belonging to and contemporaneous with the sup-
posed action (coloretur) and carefully to be distinguished from the new
consideration with which we are now occupied (anquirit animm below).

habet venerationem: Nagels. Sca. ξ 95 quotes this as an example of
the way in which the Romans supplied the absence of a Pasa, and com-
pares Orat. 111 ll, Pha. 1 7, Marcell. 26. [of. αἴσθησιν παρέχω which
is the regular passive of alcrednwem. J. S. R] Sch. in his note cites other
phrases in which habeo has the same force, e. g. laetitiam, apem, timorem
habere ‘to inspiro ’, like tho Gr. ἔχειν-παρέχειν. On the grounds of the
Epicurean worship cf. ἐξ 56 and 116, and Philod. 128 προσεύχεσθαι γὰρ ἐν
τῷ περὶ θεῶν φησίν, οὐχ οἷς λυπουμένων τῶν θεῶν εἴ μὴ ποιήσομεν, ἀλλὰ κατὰ

Defective as was the Epicurean conception of God, it was so far right that
they could see in Him an ideal pet-fection worthy of the reverence and
imitation of men, see Zeller Stoice tr. p. 439, Philod. p. 148.

metus a vi: cf. § 42 concubitus cum genere. Allen quotes Liv. 11111 15
mue a praetore, where see Weissenborn, also Madv. ξ 298. 2, on verbal
substantives followed by prepositions. The verbs tinne and metuo are used
absolutely with ab.
