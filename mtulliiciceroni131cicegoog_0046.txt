xlvi INTRODUCTION.

the Oxford Herculanemia, vol. 1 p. v, the words Ζήνωνος σχολῶν
occur in the mutilated title of the Philodemian treatise numbered

1389. This is of importance in regard to the question whether the
resemblances between Cicero and Philodemus are to be explained by
direct copying on the part of the former, or whether both writers
may not have borrowed from Zeno,

1 proceed now to point out what is the nature of these resem-
blances‚ and I think it will be seen that they cannot be simply set
aside by such remarks as Schemann's (Introd. p. 18) ‘ahnliche
Angaben und Urtheile, wie dort, kamen ohne allen Zweifel in gar
manchen anderen epikureischen Schriften ebenfalls vor? General
arguments no doubt might be a part of the common Epicurean tradi-
tion, but it is most improbable that this should be the case with
regard to minute points of criticism and to particular citatione
from the writings of opponents, some of them misin'oerpreted, and
likely therefore to have been expooed by hostile criticism, if they
were in common use. Such references are those to Xenophon's Ἀπο-
μνημονεύματα (Phil. p. 71, N. D. 31) ; to the Φυσικός of Antisthenes
(Phil. p. 7 2, N. D. 32), in support of a proposition of which we have
no information from other sources3 to the 3rd book of Aristotle's
περὶ φιλοσοφίας (Phil. p. 72 5 N. D. 33); to Chrysippus περὶ θεῶν
bk 1 (Phil. p. 77, N. D. 41), treating of the Stoic theology in general,
bk 11 (Phil. p. 80, N. D. 41) containing his explanation of the mytho·
logy of Orpheus, Musaeus, Homer* and Hesiod 5 to the περὶ τῆς
Ἀθηνᾶς of Diogenes of Babylon (Phil. p. 82, N. D. 41).

Assuming then, as we may, that there is an undoubted connexion
between the two trcatises, the next point is to determine its nature and
extent. If we compare them broadly together, we find the Epicurean
argument in the lst book of the N. D. made up of three parts, (l)
a preliminary polemio against the Platonic and Stoic views of the
origin of the world and the nature of God (ᾗ 18—24); (2) a critical
review of earlier philosophers from Thales to Diogenes of Babylon,
followed by a brief notice of the popular mythology in Greece
and elsewhere (ἓξ 25-43) 3 (3) an exposition of the Epicurean theo-
logy. Similarly the Philodemian treatise, as we have it, is made up
of three parts (l) a criticism of the popular mythology (pp. 5—61>;
(2) a criticism of older philosophers (pp. 65—89>; (3) an exposition
of the Epicurean theology (pp. 93-151). The resemblances noticed
above belong to the second, or historical section, which we will
now examine more closely. Cicero’s list of philosophers is as fol-
