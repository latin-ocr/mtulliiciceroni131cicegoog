tenere damet. Lucretius speaks in equally high terms of his master's
speculationes, 1 74 omne immensum poeaqravit mente animoque foll.

docet eam esse vim—aeterna. This extremely difficult passage has
been discussed by many writers, esp. by Sch. Opux. 111 315¹, and Neue
Jahrb. for 1875 pp. 687-691, as well as in the notes and app. to his ed. ς
but tho first to give a satisfactory explanation of the whole was Hirzel in
his Umsuchunqen pp. 46—90. He translates as follows (p. 68): ‘Epikur
lehrt die Natur der Gotter sei der Art, dass sie erstens nicht mit den
Sinncn, sondern nur mit dem Geiste erfasst wird, und dass sie ausserdem
weder Soliditiit noch individuelle Identitat besitzt, wie die sogenannten
στερέμνια 3 vielmehr gelangten wir zur Erkenntniss des Gottlichen (denn das
besagen die Worte quae eit et beata natura et aeterna) durch Bilder, die
wir wahrnehmen ' &c. I had long taken the same view of the construc-
tion of capa-e, and of the needlessness of Sch.'s emendations comantur,
cumqm, beatae naturae. The clue to the right interpretation is to be found
(1) in ξ 105, where the account here given is criticized by Cotta, and (2) in
Diog. L. x 139 ἐν ἄλλοις δέ φησι τοὺς θεοὺς λόγῳ θεωρητούς, οὓς μὲν κατ’
ἀριθμὸν ὑφεστῶτας, οὓς δὲκαθ’ ὄμοειδῖαν ἐκ τῆς συνεχοῦς· ε’πιῤῥύσεωι· τῶν
ὁμοίων εἰδώλων ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ ἀποτετελεσμένωι) ἀνθρωποειδεῖς. Philodemus
seems to have treated of the subject in his περὶ εὐσεβείας, but unfortu-
nately· the passages relating to it are too corrupt to afford much help.
See p. 110 δύναται γὰρ ἐκ τῆς· ὁμοιότητος (similitudine) ὑπάρχουσα (ἰδιότης)
&tadmor ἔχειν τὴν τελείαν εὐδαιμονίαν, ἐπειδήπερ οὐχ ἧττον ἐκ τῶν αὐτ-ὥν
ἦ τῶν ὅμοι’ων στοιχείων {utimur ἀποτελεῖσθαι δύνανται. Gomperz despairs
of the passage (see his n. ‘ dieser mir zum kleinsten Theil verstiindlichen
Columna ’,) but it would appear to be a compar-ison between our ordinary
modes of perception and the mode in which we arrive at a consciousness of
deity3 just as in the next page it is said ‘ if opponente charge Epicurus
with denying the existence of the Gods, why might they not on the same
ground charge him with denying the existence of horses and men, καὶπάνθ’
ἁπλῶς τὰ κατὰ μέρος alo-Ormi τε καὶ νοητὰ φυσεων εἶδηῬ Τ he same subject ts

ἀτόμους νομίζειν τοὺς θεους μήτε συνθέτους p. 136, apparently an exhaustive
argument to prove the atheism of Ep. ⁴ his Gods are neither atoms nor
compounds of atoms, and what other entities are admitted by himi'

f non sensu sed mente cernatur. cf. Lucretius quoted on qua-n corpus,
and ξ 105 open-iem dei percipi coyitatiom non sensu. Sch. points out that
while Ia. speaks of the tenuis natura and Cotta of the quocies, both referring
only to the fine etherial body of the Gods, Vell. speaks more generally of
vie et natura. This is because he is about to refer, ·not merely to the
