refer back ιο the last sentence but one.

taurus—Europam„ This was the subject of a statue by Pythagoras
the sculptor, oee Varro L. L. v 351 and Miiller Amicus Art ξ 351. A

painting of the same is described by Achilles Tatius at the beginning of the
Leucippe,

ingeniis—orationibus. · the plural of the concrete is osten used for the
abstract, see Nagelsb. Stil. ξ 12, and compare Div. 11 55 covy'ectura inqem'iae
diducitur‘ by man' s ingenuity', Arch„ 17 celeritatem inqmiorum (of Ros-
cius). I suppose orat. here to mean the faculty of speech, but Ι cannot
cite a parallel. [Mr Roby would prefer ιο translate it ‘by our intellects or
modes of articulation '. But the general tenor of the passage requires that
the comparison should lie between man, on the one side, and all other
animale, on the other; whereas, if we give the ordinary force ιο the plural,
it seems to me that the use of the word nostris here draws our attention to
differences existing amongst men themselves. Also the following singu·
lars speciefiyvvraque suggest a singular force for the preceding plui-als]

quodsi—velimus. Quod is connective not adversative, Madv. ξ 449,
‘ and then if we choose to (go further and) invent and combine forms for
ourselves'.

natantibus invehens beluis. Triton was represented with a human
body ending in a fish's tail ; sometimes the legs are replaced by two fish-
like bodies, between or upon which the man appears to ride, as in the
beautiful painting at Herculaneum (Roux Aine Maca Gdne'ral vol. v 36,
Μ. Borb. vul 10). It is ιο the latter form that C. allude& and also Apoll.

ὁλκαίη μηκύνετο, dcc. Cicero would be familiar with the Triton which
formed a vane on the top of the horologium of Cyn-bestes, ‘ the tower of
the winds’, at Athens, cf. Miiller Anc- Art ξ 402. For the intransitive use
of the participle cf. R. P. 111 14 invehens alitum anguium cmv-u, Phil. m 32

nolis esse. I think Sch. is right in taking this interrogatively,so
carrying on the argument of the sentence at mehercule, &a ‘I dare not
call myself more beautiful than Europa’s bull; if you could be metamor·
phosed into a Triton, would you refuse 2’ Otherwise surely the opposition
must have been more strongly marked, ⁸ and yet one would object to a
change even into the still more beautiful Triton '. As to construction, 1
think qualis refers ιο the preceding formas, and that we must supply cali
forma with esee.

difficili—versor: ‘I am on ticklish ground, I confess'.
