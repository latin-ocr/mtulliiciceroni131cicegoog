The elementary contraries, hot, cold‚ moist, dry, are separated from
this first matter by virtue of the eternal movement belonging to it3
thus are produced the four elements 3 the earth was in the form of a
cylinder‚ sels-poised‚ in the centre of the universe3 round it was air,
and round that again a fiery sphere which was broken up so as to
form the heavenly bodies. As all substances are produced out of the
Infinite so they are resol ved into it, thus ‘atoning for their injustice’
in arrogating to themselves a separate individual existence. The
Infinite is divine, containing and directing all thingst divine too are
the innumerable worlds which it is ever generating and re-absorbing
into its own bosom. (N. D. 1 25.)

After Anaximander comes Anaximenes, also of Miletus, who is
supposed to have flourished about 620 Β.ο. While his doctrine
approaches in many respecta ιο that of Anaximander, he nevertheless
returned ιο the principle of Thales in so far that he assumed as the
ἀρχή, a definite substance, Air, in contradistinction to the indefinite
ἄπειρον of his immediate predecessor. Air is infinite in extentpnd
eternal in duration. Ῑι is in continual motion, and produces all
things out of itself by condensation and rarefaction‚ passing through
successive stages from fire downwards to wind, cloud, water, earth
and stone. As man’s life is supported by breathing, so the uni-
verse subsists by the air which encompasses it. We are told that
Anaximenes gave the name of God both to his first principle
Air, and to certain of its products, probably the stara. (Ν . D.
1 26.)

The greatest of the Pte-Socratio philosophers, Heraclitus of
Ephesus, known among the ancients as the obscure and the weeping
philosopher, was a little junior to Anaximenes. Following in the
steps of his predecessor, he held that it was one and the aelf-
same substance which by processes of condensation and rarefaction
changed itseli' into all the elementa known by us, but he preferred
ιο name this from its highest potency sbre, rather than to stop a't
the intermediate stage of air. But the point of main interest with
him was not the original substance, but the process, the ever-
lasting movement upwards and downwards, fire (including air), water,
earth3 earth, water, fire. All death is birth into a new form, all
birth the death of the previous form. There is properly no existence
but only ‘becoming‚' i. a. a continual passing from one existence into
another. Each moment is the union of oppositos, bethay and not-
boinq: the life of the world is maintained by conflict, πόλεμος πατὴρ
