BOOK 1 cn. xxv1 ξ 71. 171

condensatio, ‘because all the ancient writers (except Lactantius De Ira x 28
who was no doubt misled by the ambiguity of O.'s words in this passage)
agree that the Epicurean Gods were corporeal and compounded of atoms' ;

and he defends his interpretation by the use of concretus in such passages
as 11 42, 101, Div. 1 130. I do not think we can argue from the use of the

Past Part. concretus, which implies the completion of the process, to the
verbal‚ implying the process itself3 and besides, the reference is plainly to
the sint sane ex atomis of ξ 68, where it was shown that any such coma
pound must be liable to interitus.- to avoid this danger Ep. had recourse
to his quasi-coopus ξ 69 : then came the parenthesis illustrating Ιιοο per-
saepefact’tzk, and now in ξ 71 the subject is resumed in the words ind οοη).
co‘ncr. suq. ‘he tries to escape from the agg-rogation of indivisible particles
(with its consequences as above pointed out) ’. The only concretio implied
in the Gods of ξ 49 was that of the images, involving superficial area but
not depth, cf. monoyrammus 11 59. The tamquam sanquis was probably
suggested by the Homeric ichor, 12. v 340 ρίε δ’ ἄμβροτον αἷμα θεοῖο, Ι ῐχῶρ,
οἶός· πέρ τε ῥέει μακάρεσσι θεοῖσιν· Ι οὖ γὰρ σῖτον laced, οὖ niumm? αἴθοπα
οἶνον· Ι τοῦνεκ’ ἀναίμονές εἶσι καὶ ἀθάνατοι καλέονται.

sed tamquam corpus: supply dabit esse from the preceding τιᾶραι, and

Ch. xxm. mirabile videtur—viderit. This saying of Cato the
Censor (Div. 11 51) was probably inspired by a feeling of contempt for the
Tusci ac barbari, as they are styled by the jealousy of a Roman augur
N. D. 11 11. oio„ who prided himself so much on being a member of the
augin-iai college, is indignant when a haruspex is admitted into the Senate,
Fam. VI 18. In the De Divinatiom 11 28 foll. he states the Academic argu-
ment against haruspicina, in answer to his brother Q. who, as a Stoic, was
bound to defend every kind of divination.

81 in ceris fingeretur. If the reading is correct, the sense and con-
struction require that fimq. should be taken metaphorically ‘ if such a body

’ were fancied in the case of waxen figures ’ ε otherwise the literal sense

is suggested by fictilibus and ceris (used as in Juv. vm 19, where see
Mayor's n., and ceris fingendis oblectari J ustin xxxin 4). I am inclined to
think however that the true reading is sI ΙΝ OER[1s DICERJETUR ‘if the
phraoe were used in connexion with wax figures ', cf. dicemus in Venere G'oa
just below: The repetition of css explains the omission of the letters in
brackets, and the remaining letters would be taken for εἰ fingeretur, which
would be likely to maintain its ground against the true reading, even after
the insertion of in cer& from another text. Plin. N. H. xxxv ξ 4 speaks of
the expressi cera vultus which were used in funerals, and in ξ 147 of
modelling in clay, finqere ex argilla similitudines.

ne tu quidem: ‘ n0, nor you either ². The phrase occurs in this weaker
sense § 110 ne beatus quidmn, ξ 113, 11 87, 111 23, 43, 47, 49, 68, 86, see
Madv. Mn. Exc. 111 p. 816.

ξ 72. quasi dictata redduntur: ‘you repeat your lesson like parrots’ss
