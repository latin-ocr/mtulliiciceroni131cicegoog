to obtain pleasure‚ but to steel himself against pain. Thus in the
end the Cyrenaic doctrine blends with the Oynic.

PnA'ro, the ‘dem philosophonwn’ (N. D. 11 32), was born at
Athens 428 Β.6. and became a disciple of Socrates in 408 Rc, After
the death of his master 116 left Athens and lived at Megara. with
Euclides. From thence he visited Cyrene, Egypt, Magna Graecia
and Sicily. Aster nearly ten years of travelling he took up his

> residence ‘again at Athens and began to lecture in the gymnasium

of the Academia. He died in his eightieth year.

Building on the foundation of Socrates, 116 insiste no less than his
master on the importance of negative Dialectic, as a means of testing
commonly received opinions3 indeed most of his Dialogues come to
no positive result, but merely serve to show the difficulties of the
subject discussed and the unsatisfactory nature of the solutions
hitherto proposed. As he makes Socrates the spokesman in almost
all the Dialogues, it is not always easy to determine precisely where
the line is to be drawn between the purely Socratic and the Platonic
doctrine, but the general relation of the 6116 to the other may be
stated as follows. ,

In 1116 theory of knowledge Plato unites the Socratic definition
with the Heraclitean Becoming and the Eleatic Being. Agreeing
with Heraclitus that all the objects of the senses are fleeting and
unreal in themselves, he held that they are nevertheless participant
of Being in so far as they represent to us the general terma after
which they are named. Thus we can make no general assertion with
regard to this or that concrete triangular thing: it is merely a
passing sensation: but by abstraction we may 1166 from the concrete
to the contemplation of the Ideal triangle‚ which is the object of

science, and concerning which we may make universal and absolutely
true predicatione. If we approach the Ideal from below, from the
concrete particulare, it takes the form of the 61666, the common name,
the definitiom the concept, the Idea3 but this is an incomplete view
of it. The Ideal exists apart from, and prior tc, all concrete em-
bodiment. It is the eternal archetype of which the sensible objects
are the copies. It is because the soul in its pre-existent state is
already familiar with this archetype that it is capable of being
reminded of it when it sees its shadow in the phenomenal existences
