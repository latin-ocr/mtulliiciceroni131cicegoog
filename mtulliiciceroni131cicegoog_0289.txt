quos pudeat: most of the editors spoil the irony of the ΜΘ by
inserting non. Cotta is complimenting Vell. on his superiority to the
scruples of the weaker brethren (called imperitos Fin. 1 55) who think that
there may be pure mental pleasures entirely unconnmd with the body;

Klotz Adn. Cr. 11 16 points out that if Vell. were ashamed of the doctrine

justify and explain it, as is done in the following sentence quem cibum

instance of asyndeton, or of apposition (as Klotz Adn. Urit. 11 p. 18),
while it would be a very natural glo& for a scribe to add. Omitting it,

scarcely add anything to what has been said before. For comp. ep. cf.
