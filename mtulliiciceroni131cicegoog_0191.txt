sooK1 cs. 111 §3st 119

ἀγαθοὶ πᾶσαν ἅρετήν, θεοὺς αὐτοὺς εἶναι φήσομεν, εἴτε ἐν σωμασιν boffa-aa,
(ᾤετ’ οντα, κοσμοῦσι πάντα οὐρανόν, εἴτε ὅπῃ καὶ ὅπως.

ut Graeci dicunt ἀσώματα σιν there seems no reason for doubting the
genuineness of these words, as Heind. and Ba. have done; see n. on physio-
logiam ξ 20. There is a special reason for adding the Greek here, as the
Latin equivalents were not introduced till later, imorporalis appearing
first in Seneca, incorporem in Gellius. The doctrine that all that is
corporeal is in its own nature mortal, γεννητὸν καὶ φθαρτόν, runs through

the whole of Plato (see ξ 20 n.) and we find the missen, which is eternal, ,

contrasted with things seen and temporal in Tim 285 but it is only the
Demiurgus who' is essentially incorporeal; many of the inferior deities
are clothed 1n bodies.

id—intenegi non potest: ‘a divine incorporeity is inconceivabless cs
§27 on Thalea The absence of feeling involved absence of forethought and
absence of pleasure, see ξ 48. C.' s own opinion is given Tmo. 1 50, where
speaking of those qui nequeunt qualis animm sit vacam empore intellegere et
cogitatione comprehendere, he says quasi vero intellegant qualis sit in ῄυεο
empore,- and a little further certe et deum aprum et divinum animumoorpm
liberatum cogitatione complecti volmnus. Again Tusa. 1 71 dubitare mm
possumus quin nim sit animis admit-tum,- niluz conor-etum, πιἸιιΖ copulatum,
aaa coaynoentaeum, noaz duplex. Quod cam ita eit, certe nec memineo
dividi mc discerpi nec distrahi potest, ne imen're quidm iyitur. Plato
argues against those who identified matter and existence, ταύτὸν σῶμα καὶ
edelar ὁριζόμενοι in the Sepla. 246 foll. where the term ἀσώματον occurs.

ξ 31 Xenophon: see Krische 204—234, Philodemus p. '71 ἐν τοῖς
Ξενοφῶντος ἀπομνημονεύμασιν οὐχ ὁρᾶσθαί φησιν τοῦ θεοῦ τὴν μορφὴν ἀλλὰ
τᾶργα. The passage referred to is quoted by Clem. AL Protr. ξ 71, Str-om. v
ξ 109, and by others among the early Christian writers ε it occurs in Mem,
1v 3 ξ 13, where Socrates says that Euthydemus will soon be convinced
of the providential-government of the world, if he is content to see the
Gods in their works without waiting to see them in bodily form, ἂν μὲν
μὴ ἀναμένῃς ἕως ἂν τὰς μορφὰς τῶν θεῶν ἴδῃς, ἀλλ’ ἐξαρκῇ σοι τὰ ἔργα
αὑτοῖν ὁρῶντα σέβεσθαι καὶ τιμᾶν τούς θεούς, a very different assertion from
that of the Epicurean critic here, who would identify this with the view
just before attributed to Plato (deum nominari non posse, anquiri non
debere). The next assertion et solem et animum deum is founded upon
the same passage of the Memorabilia, where Socrates illustratos our
inability to look upon God by the parallel case of the sun, ὅ πᾶσι
φανερὸς δοκῦν εἶναι ἥλιος οὐκ ε’πιτρέπει τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ἑαυτὸν ἀκριβῶς ὁρᾶν,
ἄλλ’ ἰόν τις αὐτὸν ἀναιδῶς ἐγχειρῇ θεᾶσθαι τὴν ὄψιν ἀφαιρεῖται, and of the
soul ἀνθρώπου γε ψυχή, ἣ εἴπερ τι καὶ ἄλλο τῶν ἀνθρωπίνων τοῦ θείου
μετέχει, ὅτι μὲν βασιλεύει ἐν ἡμῖν φανερόν, ὁρᾶται δὲ οὐδ’ αὕτη. It is unno-
oessary to say that in neither case does X. make the assertion attributed
to him in the text. Thirdly it is stated that X. speaks of God at one
time in the singular, at another time in the plural. This no doubt is true,
