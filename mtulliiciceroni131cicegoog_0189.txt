the lst (ns) sentence and the variety of positive assertions as to the Deity
in the ard (us) sentence, is much more glaring than the opposition
between the lst sentence and the one negative assertion of the 2nd
sentence. Beddes the idea of inconsistency runs through the 3rd sen-
tence, whereas it is entirely absent in the 2nd. 1 think also that the
repetition of et is intended to point the conti-ast, ‘after having spoken as
he did in the Timaeus and Laws, we find him in both. asserting not only
that we can name God, but that there are any number of substances which
we may call ΒΥ that name’. Taking it then aq certain that the opposition
lies between the lst and the 3rd sentences‚1 have little doubt that the 2nd
and 3rd have got misplaced. Compare the transposition in ξ 5 of the
sentences beginning qua quidem and multum autem, that in ξ 88 and
ξ 97, and many similar instances in Munro’s Lucretius, see his Intro-
duction p. 20 foll. ed. 1, also Muner in N. Jahrb. for 1864, p. 144. In the
present case and also in ξ 5 the transposition may be explained by sup-
posing the misplaced clauses (Sunt vero and Qua quidem) to have been
added on revision by C. himself, but wrongly inserted ΒΥ the scribe. See
below on idem in Ἰϊηιαοο.

inconstantia: Grote (Plato 11 161) applies this censure more generally.
The discrepancy between different dialogues is partly to be accounted for
by the change in Plato's own sentimenta during the course of a long life,
partly by the different aim and style of the particular dialogues scientific,
popular, allegorica-l.

ln Timaeo: p. 28 0. τὸν μὲν οὖν ποιητὴν καὶ πατέρα τοῦδε τοῦ παντὸς

et cum inveneris indicare in vulqus nefas. The passage was much quoted
ΒΥ the early Christian writers, e. g. Minuciusc. 19 Platoni deu-5 est mwndi

other hand Celsus made use of it against the Christian preaching of the
‘Gospel to the poor, to which Origen (v11 42) replies that the Christians not
only affirmed with Plato that it was difficult to discover the Creator, but
that it was even impossible for man to do this, except for those to whom
the Son revealed Him. Clement of Alexandria, commenting on the words
of Plato, says that, in using of the Ineffable such names as ἓν ἢ τάγαθὸν ἢ
νοῦν ἢ αὐτὸ τὸ ὃν ἦ πατέρα ἦ θεὸν ἦ δημιουργὸν ἢ κύριον, we do not profess to
name Him truly, but employ various terms as a help to the feebleness of
our own understanding, Strom v 12 83.

ln legum—censeat. As we have had occasion to suspect misrepresenta-
tion in cases where it was difficult to arrive at complete certainty in regard
to the doctrines referred to, it is a satisfaction to be able here to con-
