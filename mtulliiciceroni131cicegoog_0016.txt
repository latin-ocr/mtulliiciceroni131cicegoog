of ‘ homoeomeries‚' denoting that the constituent particles of bodies
were of the same nature as the bodies which they composed, while
the unqualitied atoms of Democritus gave rise to the different
qualities of their compounds by the mode in which they were ·
compounded. In the beginning these seeds were huddled together
in a confused chaos, then came Nou-s, the pure sels-moving intel-
ligence, almighty and all-wisc (this takes the place of the half-
conscious Love and Hate of Empedocles), and communicated a
rotatory impulse to the inert mass, by means of which the cognate
partiales were gradually brought together and reduced to order.
Nous is the soul of the world and dwells in all living things, even
plants, as the principle of their life. whether Anaxagoras called it
by the name of God is doubtful. Plato and·Aristotle complain that,
having begun well, he failed to make full use of the right principle
with which he started, and turned his attention to mechanical causes,
only having recourse to Nous as a deus ex machina when the others
failed. (N. D. 1 26.)

Diogenes of Apollonia in Crete was a younger contemporary of
Anaxagoras, against whom he took up a reactionary position and
defended the older Ionic doctrine, assuming Aio· to be the one
principle out of which all things were produced, and assigning to it
all the attributes of N oua. Both he and Anaxagoras taught at
Athens, but were compelled to leave it on a charge of impiety. (N.
D. 1 29.)

Of far greater importanoe is Democritm, born at the Ionic colony
of Abdera in Thrace, Rc. 460, the chief expositor of the Atomic
theory, which was originated by his elder contemporary and friend,
Leucippus the Eleatic (N. D. 1 66). Briefly stated, their doctrine is
that of Anaxagoras, minus N oua and the qualitative diversity in the
seeds or atoms. They adopted the Eleatic view so far as relates
to the eternal sameness of Being, applying this to the indivisible,
unchangeable atoma, but they denied its unity, continuity and im-
mobility, and they asserted that ‘N ot-being’ (the Vacwwm of their
system) existed no less than ‘Being,’ and was no less essential as an

ἀρχή, since without it motion would be impossible. The atoms are
absolutely solid and incompressible, they are without any secondary
qualitieS, and differ only in size (and therefore in weight), in figure,
position and arrangement. Though too small to be seen or felt by
us, they produce all things by their combinations3 and the com-
pounds have various qualities in accordance with the differenoes in
