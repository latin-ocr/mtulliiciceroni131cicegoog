p. 363 Β it is made the sign to distinguish between the esoteric and exoteric‚
τῆς μὲν γᾶρ σπουδαίας ἐπιστολῆς θεὸς ἄρχει, θεοὶ δι’ τῆς ἦττον) and in their
more scientific beatises, where they speak, now of the Supremo Deity
himself, now of the subordinate gods who are his agents. This distinction
appears in the same passage of the Memorabilia, οἶ τε γὰρ ἄλλοι ἡμῖν

from Philodemus p. 72 παρ’ ’Δντισθένει δ’ ἐν μὲν τῷ φυσικῷ λέγεται τὸ κατὰ
τόμον εἶναι πολλοὺς θεούς, κατὰ δὲ φύσιν ἕνα (compare Varro's classification
of .theology as fabulosum, naturale, civile Aug. 0. D. v1 ὃ).λ Before the
decipherment of this fragment, C.’s statement was unsupported by any

⁸ independent authority, but we have a saying of Ant. repomd by Theodoret

(Graec. Aff. 1 14) which agrees very well With it, θεὸς ἀπὸ εἰκόνος οὔ γνωρί-
ζεται, ὀφθαλμοῖς οὐχ ὁρᾶται, οὐδενὶ ἔοικε· διόπερ αὐτὸν οὐδεὶς ἐκμαθεῖν ἐξ
εἰκόνος δύναται.

curus and of the popular belief.

Speusippus: cf. Krische 247-258. Spengel and Sauppe in their
editions of Philodemus find an allusion to Sp. in the lines just preceding
the account of Aristotle (Gomp. p. 72) but there is nothing there which
could illustrate the account here given, which is in fact unsupported by
any ancient authority. We know hardly anything of Sp. except that he
modified the teaching of his master in the Pythagorean dimotion. The
criticism here is as reckless as in the case of Antisthenes.
