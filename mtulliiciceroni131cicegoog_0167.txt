of time in itself, are quite beside the mark. No one disputes that
this was the view of many philosophers3 the question is, what was the
Epicurean view? No doubt Vell. just below uses non-Epicurean argu-
ments, but that is where he can turn them ιο his own purpose, and make
his adversary's case destroy iteelf. Here it is his own case which is
weakened by the insertion of what 1 hold to be 8 gloss. As regards the
language of the gloss itself‚ ne in coyitatimwm quidem cadit is equivalent
ιο m ooqitm· quidem potest (Ac. 11 82) ‘it is impossible even ιο imagine
how there could have been (lit. was) anything of the nature of time before
time existed' (Ι prefer to take it thus rather than to make m· ,ῥιοτ-ἰεεριὺω
with Sch. in loco and Draeg. 5407). It only rema-ins to account for the
gloffi and this seems, like animi after oculis ξ 19, ιο be easily explained
as a correction of the Epicurean doctrine in the text, made by 8 follower
of Plato or Aristotle, who inserted 8 non before pote-nt, and gave as his
reason for negativing it quod—esset. For the use of imeaeqoe‘oonoeive’
Heidt. quotes Pin. 1 17 eumque motum atomorum nullo α principio sed ex
aeter-2⁸0 tempore intellegi convenire (where see Madv.'s n.), N. D. 1 73 istud

ξ 22. isto spatio. Why the Abl. when we have the Acc. of duration
just before, (saecla dor-mm Because in that case the sleeping is viewed as
extending right through the ages, while here the action is viewed as oon· ι
fined within this time, not extending over it ς so in tempore infinito just
below, cf. hoc spatio (in the interval) conclave concidme (De Orac. 11 353),
cacus autem innam-is paene tacendis in omnibus plura mir-abdia quam in
somnior-tom υὺίε effecit (Div. 11 147). The same difference is found in Gr.
between the Acc. of duration and the (inclusive) Gen. of time. Practically
of course the two very much overlap‚ see Roby §§ 1182, 1185. Or we might
take spatio as the AbL of Attendant circumstances, ‘though there was all
that time’‚ Roby ξ 1248.

at iste-parerent. Heidt. (p. 38) has called attention ιο the ap-
parent inconsistency of this sentence with the tenete of the speaker. That
we cannot connect the idea of toil with our idea of the divine nature is of
course of the essence of Epicureanism 3 but this is bound up with the idea
of the divine inactivity‚ whereas here it is assumed that the work of creation
may be accomplished without toil to the creator owing to the willing co·
operation of the clemente, 8 supposition which has been just ridiculed by
vell. ξ 19. There is however no reason ιο suppose any corruption of the
text, as Η. does. The argument throughout is ad hominem as shown by
the repeawd ιἐτο, im, ὦτα. To this Η. opposes the lauguage used by
Balbus ms the labour of creation 11 133 tantarum-remu molitio, tantum
taboram .· the answer to which is that B. there speaks rhetorically in 8
manner opposed to the general spirit of the Stoic philosophy to which Vell.

here appeals.
