they thought that even he had approaehed too near to dogmatism
in saying that he knew that he knew nothing. Probable opinion
was the furthest point in the direction of knowledge to which
man could atta-in. The Academic argument put into the mouth of
Cotta in the 3rd book of the N. D. is mainly derived from Clito-
machus‚ the literary exponent of the views of his master Carneades,
who is said to have never written anything himselfi The Ν ew
Academy commences with Phflo (Ν. D. 1 59, 113), a pupil of Clito-
machus and one of Cicero's teachers. In it we see a return to
dogmatism combined with an eclectio tendency which showed itself
most strongly in Philo’s pupil ⁴Antiochus (N. D. 1 6, 16), who en-
deavoured to reform the Academy by uniting Stoic and Peripatetic
doctrines with the original Platonism. Cicero studied under him
and used some of his writings for the De Finibus. Brutus, to whom
the Ν. D. is addressed, was one of the most distinguished adherente
of this stoicized Academy.

We turn now to the two most important developments of post-
Aristotelian philosophy, Stoicism and Epicureanism. To understand
them it is necessary to look for a moment at the changes which had
been brought about by the conquests of Alexander. While Greece
proper lost its national life, the Greek language and Greek civiliza-
tion spread throughout the world, and the Greeks in their turn
became familiar-ised with Oriental thought and religion. Thus the
two main supports of the authoritative tradition by which practical
life had hitherto been regulated, the law of the State and the old
religion of Greece, were shaken from their foundation& The need
which was most strongly felt by the best minds was to find some
substitute for these, some principle of conduct which should enable
a man to retain his sels-respect under the rule of brute force to
which all were subject. It must be something which would enable
him to stand alone, to defy the oppressor, to rise superior to cir-
cumstances. Such a principle the Stoics boasted to have found.
Zeno (N. D. 1 36 ab), the founder of the school, was a native of
Citiuffi in Cyprus. He came to Athens about 320 Rc. and attended
the lectures of Crates the Oynie and afterwards of Stilpo the Mega.-
rian and of some of the Academics, and began to teach in the στοαί
roman about 308 Rc. He was suceeeded by Cleanthes of Assos in
Asia Minor about 260 no, (N. D. 1 37, 11 13, 24, 40, 111 63). Among
his other pupils were Aristo of Chius (N. D. 1 37), Herillus of
