Π 4, e. g. Tmo. v 81, optima qui-sque valetudine affectus potest videri natura

tional impropriety to suggest the impossibility of reason possessing the
attribute of divinity‘l

astris: cf. 11 39 foll. ,

annis—mutationibus: see Zeller Stoica tr. p. 121 foll. who mentions,
among other extravagant conclusions drawn from the Stoic axiom ‘ all that
*existe is material ², the statement attributed to Chrysippus that the voice
was a body, that qualities are bodies, nay rational creaturos (Plut. Comm.
Noc. 45), that diseases, vices and virtues are bodies (Seneca Epp. 106, 117,
and especially 113 animal constat animum esee. Virtus autem nihil aliud
eat quam animm quodam modo se habau.- erqo animal eat). He quotes also
the words of Chrysippus (ap. Plut. l. ο.) in which it is distinctly asserted 0
that night and day, the month and the year, summer and autumn, δια, are
bodies, adding that ‘ by these unfortunate expressions Chrys. appears to
have meant little more than that the realities corresponding to these names
depend on material conditions, e. g. by summer is meant the air heated by
the sun’. ·
· demutat—interpretatur. The device of allegorical intbrpretation is
naturally resorted to when it is desired to retain old forms which are
felt to be inconsistent with new beliefs. As Philo allegorized the Jewish
Scriptures in order to bring them into harmony with his own Platonism, so
the Stoics allegorized the Hellenic Scriptures (Homer and Hesiod) with the
view of hiding the divergenoe between their own philosophy and the
popular religion, cf. Heraclides Aa. Hom. proem. Ὅμηρος ἠσέβησεν εἷ μὴ
ἦλληγόρησεν, Orig. c. C'ele. 1 17, 1v 48 (where Cels. says the more respectable
Jews and Christiane take refuge in allegory, being ashamed of the literal
sense of their sacred books, to which Or. replies in the following chapters),
Lobech Agyl. pp. 133, 155 foll„ Zeller Stoica tr. ch. 13, p. 334 foll. Plato
alludes to the allegorizing process as already rife in his time, Rep. 11 378,
Phaedrus 329. For Stoic exx. see below ξ 41 aeq. 11 63 seq.

this reading against Lambinus' emendation imita-s perceptasque.

neque enlm-appelletur: ‘ neither (the actual) Jupiter nor any one
who is addressed in that way, i.e. as a person', [or ‘who bears a name of
such a kind, i. e. a proper name ². Β.] Davies, followed by Heindorf and
Schemann, reads affdlatwr against the best uss. I understand the Subj.
