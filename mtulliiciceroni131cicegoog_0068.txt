slightingly of the value of these readings: ‘Elimia' varias lectioms
siqnificat, quas σω us quodam vir doctus editioni Roberti Stephani
A. D. mxxxtx adlevit. Iste codex, quantum judiam-e (ἰαύων, non
maynam prae se tulit vetustatem. It will be seen that Daviae here
employs the Sing. Godoet, as he also does in the list of uss used by
him for the Academica I, ΑΛ). 1725 (collationem ΜΒ factm in σω-
emplari editionis Stephanivm) while for Academica II he mentions on
the same page varim lectiones ex duobus uss omem-pm et adlitas orac
editionis Stephanicaa Yet again, after having stated in the Presace
to the lst ed. of the Tusculana 1708, that Bp. Moore had lent him
his Stephanus cum duobus optimis uss collatam, 116 adds in the 2nd
ed. 1723 hos mimam primum ac secundum nomincovi: iic nunc
accessit ab eadem manu tertius in perqamena scriptus, and cites all
three together in his notes as Elicnses tres, e. g. on nisi haereret 1 52⁷.
From this it would appear that the collations of the two codices were
in the same handwriting, and that Davies, after he had brought out
his lst ed., discovered in Bp. Moore's Library a complete text of the
Tusculans copied out by the writer of the collations. No mention is
made of these uss in the Preface to either of the editions of the
De Divinatione and De Fato 1721 and 1730, nor have Ι come across
any reference ιο them in the notes to the Dc Divinatione, but cod. El.
appears frequently in the notes to the Dc Face.

Bentley's Life and Letters furnish some additional information
on the earlier history of the Codices, In J uly 1692 Bentley, writing
to Graevius, who was then engaged on a new edition of his Cicero,
informs him that Moore, at that time Bishop of Norwich, is pre-
pared ιο send him lectiones variantes in Libris Philocoploicis Ciceronis,
quac ex vetusto codice descripserat quidam in ora cd. Rob. Stephani in
sol. Graevius, in his reply (Sept. 1692), accepts with thanks the
Bishop's offer, but says that he must finish the orations before 116 can
proceed ιο ι116 Philesophical works. In J an. 1693 Bentley writes
again ιο say that the Bishop will send the volume itself, and remarks
in reference to the value of the readings quamtivis esse pretii re ipsa
comperies. Graevius, writing in the following December, acknow-

, ledges the receipt of the volume, which, he says, he will guard nimia

diliycntius αυὼῑ all posterity shall know how grateful he is ιο ι116
lender. Frequent allusions ιο ι116 book appear in the subsequent
correspondence, but Graevius is still too busy ιο make use of it, until
at last the Bishop becomes impatient, and Bentley writes in Aug.
