phenomenul world. Parmenides must be right in denying motion
and multiplicity, for their assertion leads to sels-contradiction. Zeno
was in consequence called the inventor of Dialectic. His arguments,
especially the famous ‘Achillea’ still find a ΡΜ in treatises on
Logic (N. D. 111 82).

The clearly marked opposition between the Ionic and the Eleatic
views of nature, as shown in Heraclitus and Parmenides, had a.
powerful influence on the subsequent course of philosophy. Em-
pedocles, Anaxagoras, and the Atomists agreed in accepting the
Eleatic principle of the immutability of substance, while denying its
absolute Oneness3 and they explained the Ionio ‘becoming' as the
result of the mixture of a number of unchangeable substances.
Empedocles of Agrigentum (b. 500 ne.) held that there were four
etet-nal, aelf—subsistent elementa or ‘ roots of things‚' which were
being continually separated and combined under the influence of
Love and Hatred. At times Love has the upper hand, at times
Hate. When Love has the complete supremacy the elementa are
at rest, united in one all-including sphere (Σφαῖρος)τ when Hate
prevails, the elementa are entirely separate. The souI, like all other
things, is formed by the mixture of the elements, and is thus capable
of perception, for like can only be perceived by like. In his opinions
on the Gods and on religion, Empedocles was chiefly influenced by
Pythagoras. He believed in the existence of Daemons intermediate
between Gods and men, some of which had passed into mortal bodies
as an atonement for former sins, and could only be restored to their
original state after long ages of discipline. While he speaks of
God at one time as one spirit pervading the world in swift
thought, in other places he speaks of Gods produced like men from
the mixture of the elementa, but possessed of a longer existence, and
then again we find divinity attributed to Sphaerus and the four ele-
menta and two moving powers (N. D. 1 29).

Beturning now to Ionia, we see the effect of the Eleatic school in
the speculations of moras of Clazomenae (b. 500 Β.ο.), of whom
Aristotle says that he appeared among the older philosophers like
a sober man among drunkards. Instead of the four elements of
Empedocles, which *he declared to be themselves compounds, he
assumed an indefinite number of ‘ seeds ' of the different kinds of
matter. To these seeds later philosophers gave the distinctive name
