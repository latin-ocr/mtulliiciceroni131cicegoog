lii INTRODUCTION.

that of Velleius (ἓ 59). It would further seem that Cicero has pre-
served Zeno’s sharp sayings, which were sostened down by the gentle:-
Philodemus, who may also have added a good deal of his own in the
later section ¹. But then why does the historical review stop at the
middle of the 2nd century 3.οΛ It seems as if we must go back
a step further and trace Zeno’s criticisms to Apollodorus ὅ κηποτύ-
parvos, the predecessor of Zeno in the chair of Epicurus, who flou-
rished towards the end of the 2nd century 13.c. and is said to have
written more than 400 books (Zeller Stoice tr. p. 389).

With regard to the sources of the other two sections Ι do not think
we are yet able to arrive at any positive conclusion. It is possible
that Zeno wrote a treatise περὶ θεῶν in four books, the lst disproving
what might be considered the orthodox theology of Plato and the
Stoice, the 2nd giving a history of the traditional beliefs, the 3rd a
history of philosophical speculation on the same subject, the 4th
containing the views of the most advanced Epicureans 3 but it is
equally possible that Phaedrus (as suggested by the letter to Atticus)
may have been the authority copied by Cicero for his first and last
sections ; on the other hand it is quite possible that Ο. may have
found his treatise unsuited to his purpose.

We proceed now to inquire what is the original source of the
criticism of Epicurus which is put in the mouth of Cotta. It is
natural at first sight to suppose that this, as well as the criticism of
the Stoical doctrines assigned to Cotta in the third book, is derived
from Clitomachus, the editor of the writings of the great Academic
critic, Carneades. But further consideration shows that there are
many difficulties in the way of this identification. Carneades is
quoted by name in bk. 111 29, 41, but never in bk. 1, where, on the
contrary, we find Posidonius referred to as the authority from whom
a part of the argument is borrowed (5123), and Schwencke has
pointed out the strong vein of Stoicism which runs through the
speech. Compare for instance the jest at the expense of the Academy
in 580, the definitions of sanctitas and pietas in 5 115, the view of
wisdom as a bond of union not only between man and man, but
between man and God ἓ 121, the idea of virtue as an active principle

² Hirzel assigns the historical section to Philodemus, as the author, and the
earlier and later sections to Zeno. Schwencke would give alltc Zeno (pp. 5657).
Diels (p. 126) is inclined to make Philodemus copy from Phaedrus, which does
not seem to me probable.
