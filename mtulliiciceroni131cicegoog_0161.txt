Phaednoe, cf. Grote’s Plato Vol. 111 ch. 36 p. 282 fon. Ambrose objecting
from the Christian side, says (Her. 1 3) ‘the Creator had no need of art

quae molitio—fuerunt. The objection is ‘ if we take the -term δημιουρ-
γός literally and look on the Creator as a gigantis builder‚ where was the
needful machinery to be found? or if we accept Plato’s view that the
δημιουργός was incorporeal, and therefore incapable himself of touching or
being touched, whom did he employ as his agents? If on the other hand
we think of a divine fiat, how could senseless matter act in obedience to
this, and what was the origin of those four elements themselves 2‘ See the
answer to this, together with a fragment from N. D. 111, in Lact. [ωε.

muneris: used of a public spectacle or a building made over to public
use. So in C.‘s translation of the Rmaem (c. 2), is qui aliquod munus
efficere molitwr==6 δημιουργός (Pl. Tim. 28 Δ). It is joined with opus in
reference to the creatiom N. D. 11 90 architectum tanti open} tantique
muner-123, and Tusa. 1 70. cf. Vell. Pat. II 48 and 130. [Mr Roby suggests
that munus in this sense may be etymologically connected with munio and
mom]

illae quinque formae: Plato represents the Demiurgus as educing the
four elements out of the primaeval chaos (materia prima, ὕλη, χώρα, τὸ
δεχόμενον) by stamping upon it certain geometrical forms, the combination
of which gave rise to the five regular solids. The material particles which
received the form of the cubo constituted earth, those which were in the
form of a pyr-amiel constituted fire‚ the octokedron was the basis of air, the
ozooeiloedron of water, while the dodecaleedron was the basis of the universe
itself, cf. Tim. 48 Β, 530 foll„ Grote's Plato 111 p. 266 foll„ R. and P.

Des. or. 34 p. 428, Qu. Conv. VIII 2, 3. This theory was borrowed from
the Pythagoreans (Plut. de Pl. Pk. 11 6). In the Epinomis 981 o aether
appears as a fifth clement, quinta samaia, corresponding to the dodeca-

hedron, and this agrees with the statement of Xenocrates preserved in the ·

Scholia to Arist. Phys. p. 427 Brandis. It is strange that none of the editors
before Sch. saw the right meaning of the present passage. The reference to
the five solids is unmistakable by any reader of the Timaeus, if it is once
recognized that reliqua can only be the four elements just spoken of.
Davies however seems to have been thinldng more of the latter part of the ‘
sentence where the uss have apte cadentes ad animum ffciendum, and
puzzled himselfto find five constituente of mind (Plato Tim. 35 A having
mentioned only three—the indivisible essence of ideas ταύτόν, the divisible
essenos of bodies θάτερον, the mixture of both), instead of constituente of
