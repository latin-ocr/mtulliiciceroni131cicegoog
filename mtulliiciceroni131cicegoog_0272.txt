which, if we may believe Diog. x 3, were especially venomous in the csse
of Epicurus. Among the female members of the school were Themista,
wife of the Epicurean Leonteus, to whom C. jestingly alludes as a sort of
female Solon in his speech against Piso, licet Themista sapientior eis, and
Leontium, the mistress of Epicurus, here mentioned. Her attack on
Theophrastus is noticed by Plin. N. H. praef. 23, who also mentions two
portraits of her by distinguished artists (xxxv 36 36 and 40 19).

Eur. Or. 1657) ἀνῃρέθη, Athen. 1111 p. 611. It is supposed that ‘Diotimus’
should be read for ‘ Theotimus ², as we are told that a Stoic of the former
name fathered spurious letters on Ep. with the view of discoediting his
moral character, Diog. L. x 3. For Zeno see ξ 59 n.
