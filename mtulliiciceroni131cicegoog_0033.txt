here. It will have been noticed that many representatives of the
school were not of Greek birth, but only connected with Greece
by the Macedonian conquests. It was easy to rise from this fact
to the higher doctrine which flowed naturally from their first princi-
ple, the doctrine namely that all men were members of one state,
that the world is the common Oity of Gods and men, that all men
are brethren as having the same Divine Father.

Epicureanism may be roughly described as a combination of the
physice of Democritus with the ethics of Aristippus. Epicurus
(341-270 Rc.) was an Athenian, born in Samos, where he is said
to have received instruction in the doctrines of Plato and Democritus
(N. D. 1 7 2 ὠ 93). He founded his school at Athens about 306 13.C.,
teaching in his own ‘Gardem' which became not less famous than the
Stoic ‘Porch'. Among his most distinguished disciples were Metro—
dorus (N. D. 1 86, 113) and others mentioned N. D. 1 93. Cicero men-

. tions among his own contemporaries Phaedrus, Zeno of Sidon (N. D. 1

59, 93) and Philodemus of Gadara: and his account of the Epicurean
doctrines is probably borrowed from these, especially from the last. ’
Epicureanism had great success among the Romans3 but, with the
exception of the poet Lucretius, none of the Latin expounders of
the system seem to have been of any importance. Cicero speaks
with great contempt of Amafinius and Rabirius (cf. Tusc. 11 7, and
Zeller on the Epicuream, ch. 15).

The end of the Epicurean philosophy was even more exclusively
practical than that of the Stoics. Logic (called by Epicurus ‘Canonic’‚
as giving the ‘canon' or test of truth) and physics‚ were merely sub-
ordinate to ethice, the art of attaining happiness. Knowledge iu
itself is of no value or interest. In fact it has a tendency to corrupt
and distort our natural judgment and feeling: and thus Epicurus
prided himself on being mainly sels-taught (N. D. 1 7 2). Truth is
based on the senses: our sensations are always to be trusted: error
comes in when we begin to interpret them. Repeated sensatione
produce a permanent image or general notion (πρόληψις, so called
because it exists in the mind as an anticipation of the name which
would be unmeaning if it could not be referred to a known type).
These general notions also are to be trusted as a natural and spon-
taneous growth. But opinions (ὑπολήψεις) about these may be either
true or false5 true, if testified to by the sensatiom or, supposing such
direct evidence nnattainable‚ if there is no contrary sensation ,- false,
