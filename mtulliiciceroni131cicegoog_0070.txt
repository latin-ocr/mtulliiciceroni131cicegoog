Of ‘Med’ l know nothing beyond the fact that it was used by
Daviee for the Tusculana, De Leyibue and De Divinatione as well as
for the Natura Deorwm, and that in the preface to the De Leqibzoe he
describes it as a us of about 300 years old.

As regards the velue 01 111000 1103, Madvig in his Preface to the
De Finibw makes a broad distinction between coe El. 1 and οόᾱ.
El. 2, considering the latter to belong either to the better or to the
mixed class of 1180, while he has 110 hesitation in classing the former
with the inferior uss, He finds fault with Davies for 00 frequently

confounding the two. In the let book 01 1110 MD. I notice three

generally accepted readings, which rest either wholly or chiefly on
the authority of cod. El„ imcimtiam 51, vim 539, 0000 §863 and
two in the 2nd Bk. resting on cod. Reg., nuptoem dicunt 566, hic

quaerat quispiam 5133. It is evident from these facts that it would
be of great service to Ciceronian criticism, if the uss could be re—
covered and carefully collated.
