from groes corruption of manners ², i. e. from abnormal moral development
(αισι-128913 of 0.); ‘ or from false philosophy ’, ie. from abnormal intel-
lectual development (Diagorae, &c.): Plato Leq. 1 886 Α fou. assigna the
two latter causes for the educated unbelief of his time, (l) ἀκρατείᾳ videdit

immanitate efferatae: ‘ so utterly barbarous', lit. ‘run wild in savage-
ness'. The words are often combined, e.g. 11 99 ten-am immanitate belua-

ξ 63. Diagoram cf. ξς 2, 117, 111 89. He was a native of Melos (hence
the epithet ὅ Μήλιος-εαιὴοίεή, used by Aristophanes of Socrates Nub. 830),
a disciple of Democritus, refided in Athens for several yeQ but fled from
it to avoid an action for impiety in 411 Β.ο.; a price was set on his head
for divulging the mysteries, cf. Schol. on Arist, Av. 1073 and Stahr’s Art. in

, Did. of Bioq. Philodemus p. 85 maintains that he was a better theist than

the Stoice, and says that any supposed writings of 1118 which appear to show
the contrary are either spurious or mere jeus εἴαρι-εἳ ,· 111 proof of this he
quotes the following from his genuine poenis, θεὸς, θεὸς πρὸ παντὸς ἔργον
βροτείου νωμᾷ φρένα ὑπερτάταν and κατὰ δαίμονα καὶ τύχαν τὸ πάντα βρο·
τοῖσιν. Sext. Emp. nath. αἲξ 53 says that 118 loet 1118 saith after this was
written, ἀδικηθεὶς ὑπό τινος ἐπιορκήσαντος, eoo Fabricius in loc.

Theodorus: see Introduction under Aristippus, Zeller’s Socrates tr.
pp. 342, 376 fon. and Βία. of Bioq. Many striking sayings of his are
recorded, as that on his banishment from his native country, κακοῖς ποιεῖτε
ἄνδρες Κυρηναῖοι ἐκ τῆς Λιβύης εἷς τὴν Ἑλλάδα με ἐξορίζοπες Diog. L. 11 103,

through the influence of Demetrius Phalereus from being cited before the
Areopagum circ. 310 110.

Plato Theaet. 162 n. According to the ordinary use of words, O.’s transla-
tion could only mean ‘ Ι em unable to say either how they exist or how
they do not exist ', which is of course not the sense of the Greek. Are we
tc consider it a mistranslation, or a forcing of the usage of the language in
