identifying it with the books referred to by Arist. An. 1 2 in the phrase ἰν
τοῖς περὶ φιλοσοφίας λεγομένοις. Bomays givoe a filll account of it in his
Die Dialoqe d. Aristoteles pp. 95-114. From this it appears that the
lst book was concerned with the prae-philosophie speculations of the East
and of Greece: the discussion respecting Orpheus N. D. 1 107 is supposed
to have belonged to this. The 2nd book dealt with the earlier philo-
sophers, including Plato ; the quotation in Tmo. 111 68 is probably taken
from it. The 3rd book, in which Aristotle gave his own view, is largely
quoted from in the speech of Balbus, N. D. 11 42, 44, 95 and without
rcference in ἐξ 37, 51, cf. Bywater in Journal os Philoloqy vol. vn pp. 64—
87, and the fragments as they are given by Heitz in the Paris, or Rose in
the Berlin, edition of Aristotle.

non dissentiens. Colotes is attacked by Plutamh Π. 1115 for identi-
fying the doctrines of Plato and the Peripatetics. It was the view of
Antiochus and the eclectics, and is often propounded by Ο. as his own, cf.
Fin. 1v 5, Ac. 1 17, Leq. 1 38.

menti tribuit divinitatem. In Mae. x11 6, 7 foll. God is defined as ζῷον
αἴδιον ἄριστον, pure incorporeal reason, νόησις νοήσεως, ever engaged in con-
templation of himself, who himself unmoved has from all eternity moved
all other things by a divine atti-action (κινεῖ ὥς ἐρόμενον, cf. Gen. et Gerr. 11
10 en ἅπασιν ἇιῖ τοῦ βελτίονος ὀρέγεται ἦ φύσις). Noble as this view ie, it
yet presente some points of contact with the Epicurean theolow, which
might have been taken advantage of, if the critic had had any other object
beyond that of depreciating all who preceded his master.

mundum ipsum deum. Compare Eth- Nic. vn 14 πάντα γὰρ φύσει ἔχει
τι θεῖονς Cael. 11 1, where ὅ πᾶς eriperes· is said to be ἀθάνατον καὶ θεῖον, and
just below ‘we shall speak most suitably about it if we regard it as God’;
again ο. 3, θεοῦ ἐνέργεια ἀθανασία· ὥστ’ ἀνάγκη τῷ θείῳ κίνησιν didam· ὑπάρχειν·
ἐπεὶ δ’ ὅ οὐρανὸς τοιοῦτος (σῶμα γὰρ τι θεῖον) διὰ τοῦτο...κύκλφ ἀεὶ κινεῖταις
also Met. 111 8 ‘it has been handed down in mythical form from ancient
times that the first mover‚ and the world which it sets in motion, are Gods,
and that all nature is encircled with divinity: but this high doctrine was
mixed up with anthropomorphic conceptione. Eliminating these, we shall
hold that it was a divine inspiration which led our ancestors to the con·
clusion θεοὺς τὰς spatia-ae οὐσίας εἶναι’. These expressions however are notto
be understood in a Stoic sense as though Aristotle identified the world and
God. Transcendence is a distinct feature of the Platonic and Aristotelian
theology as opposed to the Stoic Immanence.

allum quendam: Sch. understands this of the quinta natura, the aether
of which the heaven itself and the heavenly bodies are composed, but this
is the ardor of the next clause: besides, Aristotle never represents it as
presiding over the universe or setting it in motion. Krische is, Ι believe,
right in taking it of the one supreme God, who has been already referred
to as mm, but now appears in another character as the Firstmoven cf.
