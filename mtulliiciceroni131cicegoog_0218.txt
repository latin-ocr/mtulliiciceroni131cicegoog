rally, Diog. L. x 48 ῥεῦσις ἀπὸ τῶν σωμάτων τοῦ ἐπιπολῆς συνεχὴς συμβαίνει
οὐκ ἐπίδηλος αἰσθήσει διὸ τὴν ἀνταναπλήρωσιν, Lucr. Π 26 foll. esp. 87 ‘out-
lines of shapes flit about so exquisitely fine as each by itself to be invisible',
104, 256 ‘the things themselves are seen, though the images which strike
the eye are invisible ’, 190 ‘the images succeed one ffither like the rays of
light ², suppeditatur enim confestim lumine tumn, (accounting for the
movements of shapes seen in dreams) ‘ so great is the velocity‚ so great the
supply of things ², tantaque cemibili quovis est temporo in uno Ι copia parti-
cularum ut possit suppeditare ,· and see the passages quoted from Philodemus
under docet eam esse vim. From these it would appear that the phrase
must mean ‘ when the images have become perceptible through their mutual
similarity and their uninterrupted succession'. Any one image would be
too fine to attract the attention, but the repetition of similar‘ images ever
streaming onwards‚ produces on the mind the impression of one unchanging
object. A familiar illustration would be the rainbow‚ or the wheel of fite
produced by rapidly whirling round a burning stick. I agree with Hirzel
in rejecting Sch’s explanation of simaaudo as referring to the likeness
between the images and the mind on which they impinge 3 on the other
hand transitio, lit. ‘the passing before the eyes ’ (as in ovid Rem. Am. 615
multaque corporibus transitione nocent) appears to me to be a translation of the
Gr. φορά, not (as Hirzel takes it) of ἀνταναπλήρωσιν-ιι· which· is rather supp&
ditacio. There is a slight' maccuracy here‘ m the use of tram„ it 1s applied
as though by an ab extra spectator to a stream of images‚· not passing
before, but coming full into the eyes or the mind. ’

cum infinita—affluat. Hirzel and C. F. Mliller have adopted Briegoe’s
emendation cerie-5, which certainly reads more easily with &finita- On the
other hand species is the technical term· to denote the mental impression
produced by the imagines (cf. ξ 107 sac imayines essemrpoeoes dumtaxat
objicitur, · Div. 11 137 nulla species coyitari potest mbipuleu imaginum, · Fac.
43 visum objectum imprimit et quasi signat in animo suam speciem) so that
I should have been inclined to keep the old reading, translating ‘there
rises up a never-ending impression of exactly similar images produced
from countless atoms’, were it not for the following affluat, which is very
suitably used of the series imaqinum flowing 1n upon the mind (cf. Dw.
l. c.), but less suitably of the species which springs up within the mind
itself as a result of the inflowing ἐπαφίησι. Stin we have fluuium

images were composed either of the surface atoms of the ρτερέμνιον (Lucr.
lv 67 praesertim cum sinc in cummis corpora abac Ι multa mim jaci
quae possint ordine eodem Ι quo fiacr-int et formai cer-vare figuram) or of locse
atoms floating about in the air (Lucr. lv 129 foll.). Zeller (Eng. tr. p. 448)
strangely translates ‘ pictures emanating from innumerable divine indi·
viduals' (qo'ttlickcn Individucn in the original).
