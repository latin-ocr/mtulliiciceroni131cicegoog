Ab. cle defence against his critice. He had always been a
student of philosophy, but had only lately begun to write upon it,
partly by way of useful employment in his enforced absence from
public life, partly as a solace under his heavy loss. His manner of
expounding the different tenets of each school without stating his
own opinion was intentionally adopted to provoke thought. The
Academic school to which he belonged was unfairly branded as
sceptical. It simply maintained the doctrine of probability in oppo—
sition to Stoic dogmatism. 111 5—v 12.

Ac. Preamble to the dialogue itself. In order that the reader
may be enabled to form his own judgment, O. reports a conversation
held at the house of Cotta in which the Epicureans were represented
by Velleius, the Stoice by Balbus, the Academics by Cotta, Cicero
forming the audience. w ·13-17.

Ba. Epicurean polemio against the orthodox theology of Plato
and the Stoica with their beliefs in a Creator, a mundane God, and
a superintending Providence. vm 18—x 24.

Bb. Histoi-ica] Section.

i. Epicurean criticism of the theological tenets of twenty seven
philosophers from Thales to Diogenes of Babylon. x 25—xv 41.

ii. Epicurean criticism of the popular belief, as seen in the
writings of the poete or in Oriental religions. xv1 42, 43.

Bc. Epicurean exposition. ‘Universal consent is a sufficient proof
of the existence, blessedness, and immortality of the Gods. Such
Gods must be free from care and passion, and are to be regarded
with reverence, but without sear. Experience and reason both assure
us that they are formed like men, but their bodies are of far finer
texture than oure, and are perceptible to the mind alone, not to the

. bodily senses. That they are immortal is farther shown by the law

of equilibrium, which provides that what is deficient in one place is
compensated for in another. Thus the destructive forces which pre-
vail in this mortal region are balanced by conservative forces else·
where. To believe in a divine Creator and Governor of the world is
to believe in a God who is full of care and trouble himself, and who
causes pain to others, and is therefore an object of superstitious fear.
The God of Epicurus pasees his time in tranquil contemplation, while
worlds are made and unmade by the fortuitous movements of innu-
merable atoms throughout the infinity of space. xvl 43—xx 56.
