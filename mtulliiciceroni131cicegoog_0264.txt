a terris: the plural is unusual in thissensathough inAqr. 1162we
find in tem-12³, meaning ‘ the whole world '. ‘

ab isdem principiis: ‘starting from the same point they finish their
course in longer or shorter time'. For the Pl. cf. Orat. 1 121 exalbescam ὑι

ita fit. ‘it follows from this¹‚ cf. §§ 37,121.

Ἴ meditmanci· . Verr. v 70 homines mediterranei are opposed to homines

' maritimi just before.

quae sunt tantae animi angustiae: ‘what an excess of narrow-
mindednese is this’! cf. ξ 90 quis iste tamus casm? and Virg. Geo. 1v
495 quis tantus furor 9 Heind. following Davies and Walker took quae
as the relative and joined these words to the following sentence, but the
exclamation is more Ciceronian here, and the connexion tantae ut putam
would be very harsh, especially coming after the comparison as to the
mediterranei.

ut—non crederes: ‘in like manner (lit. just as), supposing you had
been born in Seriphus and had never seen any animal larger than a fox,
you would never have believed in the existence of lions’. Sch. compares 11

esse dicam, and refers to Madv. Ra. Π 30 utmei vitajuctmda addatw,
where other exx. are given.

Seriphi: one of the Cyclades used as a place of banishment under the
Empire‚ proverbial forits insignificance and the boma tone of its inhabi-
tants, ct Mayor on Juv. x 170, ΑΘῙ. H. A. 111 37, Plato Rop. 1 329 (the
famous story of Themistocles and the Seriphian‚ which is also given by C.
Serica. ξ 8).

(ξ 97) an quicquam—vidimus. 1 have followed Bake (Haemos. n 4
p. 414) in transposing this passage, which comes in very inappropriately
where it is placed in the uss, separating two sentences which clearly belong
to each other, and having itself no proper connexion with what precedoe3
while here, on the contrary, it serves to round off what was previously
abl-apt, and makes an easier transition to the new topic introduced in et tu
quidem Vellei. connecting it thus I understand an to refer to quae suat
anqmtiae? ⁸(is it not nalrrow-mindedness) or (still to prees the same point)
can we imagine anything more childish than to deny the existence of the
animale which inhabit the Red Sea’? απ implying ‘the needleesness of the
preceding remark’, Roby ξ 2255.

quae gignantur: there is no occasion for reading the Indrwith Sch.. or
for any elaborate explanation, such as Muner gives Adn. orit. p. v1: the
Subj. is that which naturally belongs to a subordinate relative clause in
