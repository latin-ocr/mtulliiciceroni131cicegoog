(2) 1 have always written u aster υ, Miiller generally does so,
e.g. vult in 5 13, 33, 34, 69, vultis in ᾖ 89, 103, 1073 Vaedoamoe

5 45, leves 5 59, similes ᾖ 90, 91, veum-antes 5 85, noctes 5 54 though
patrm comes just before. Baiter consistently gives -2‘3 in all cases.

(4) I have regularly assimilated, where it was allowable‚ because
there is no doubt that assimilation was the tendency of the Latin
language, and was practised in speaking even in the exceptional
cases where it was necessary to preserve the spelling unaltered for
the purpose of distinctness or to show the etymology, as in adsum
(Roby, Vol. 1. p. 49 n.); Muuer as a rule does not assimilate, but we
find exceptione, as in regard to the assimilation of v’n before labials:
before b,· inbecillus 5 122, but imbecillus 5 45.

p ,· inpurus 5 63, inpudemer 5 69 δια, but impius 5 63, impendeo
