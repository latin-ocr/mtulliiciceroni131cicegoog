autem dico ipsum Epicurum nescire (quid eit voluptas) im eoque nutare.

tum enim censet: see Sext. Emp. 11 19 Δημ. δὲ εἴδωλά τινά φησιν
ἕμπελᾶζειν τοῖς ἀνθρώποις καὶ τούτων τὰ μὲν εἶναι ἀγαθοποιά, τὰ δὲ κακοποιιί.
ἔνθεν καὶ εὔχεται εὐλόγωνῑ τυχεῖν εῖδόλων. εἶναι δὲ ταῦτα μεγάλα τε καὶ
ὑπερμεγέθη, καὶ δύσφθαρτα μέν, οὐκ ἄφθαρτα δι’, προσημαίνειν τε τὰ μέλλοντα

δυσπαρόδεκτον. Of. Plut. M. 361 of the daemons of Xenocrates. ‘ It will
be obvious ' (says Mosheim in hie excellent note on Cudworth 11 p. 644)

‘from a comparison of these passages, that one and the same opinion of
Dem. is here broken up into several tenets by O. Perhaps here, as in

· other cases, he hes designedly perverted the opinion of this philosopher in

order with better effect to confuto him'. The prinmpia menti-s are the
flery particles of which soul is composed3 these coalesco and constitute
the imagines which float around us, and which, when they enter into our
consciousness (itself composed of the same divine particles), are recognized ae
divinities. Democritus attributed to them vast size, a lengthened but not
everlasting existence (see Plut. Des. Or. p. 415 ὁ δὲ Ἠσίοδος οἴεται καὶ
περιόδοις τισὶ χρόνων γίγνεσθαι τοῖς δαίμοσι τὰς τελευτάς, thus the Naiad's
life is ten times as long ae that of the phoenix, which is itself nine times
that of the raven), benigth or malignant influence, in order to agree
with the popular theology: and for the same reason, we may suppose, he
considered them to be perceptible by the lower animale (as Athene by
the dogs in the Odyoeey), cf. Clem. Strom. v 590 0, τὰ γὰρ αὐτὰ πεποίηκεν
εἴδωλα τοῖς ἀνθρώποις προσπίπτοντα καὶ τοῖς ἀλόγοις ζῴοις ἀπὸ τῆς· θείας
οὐσίας.

dorf’s suggestion, changed the Ind. of the uss for the Subj.‚ stating an
opinion, not a fact, and hes been followed by the later edd.
