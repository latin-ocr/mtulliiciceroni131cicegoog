and more generally, right action is reasonable action3 in other
words, virtue is wisdom, and each particular virtue, such as courage
or temperance, wisdom in reference to particular circumstances or
a particular class of objects. Self-mastery and superiority to the
outward conditions of life are essential to happiness.

In regard to religion, Socrates, while often employing language
suited to the popular polytheism, held that there was one supreme
God who was to the universe what the soul of man was to his body,
that all things were arranged and ordered by Him for good, and
that man was the object of His special providence and might look ,
for guidance from Him in oracles and otherwise. The soul was
immortal‚ and had in it a divine clement. Socrates ‘believed that
he was himself favoured beyond others in the warning sign (τὸ
δαιμόνων) which checked him whenever he was about to take an
ill-judged step.

The personal enmity provoked by the use of the Socratic elenchus,
and the more general dislike to the Socratic method as unsettling the
grounds of belief and undermining authority, a dislike which showed
itself in the Clouds of Aristophanes as early as 423 Β.ο., combined
with the democratic reaction‚ after the overthrow of the Thirty, to
bring about the execution of Socrates in the year 399 120. The
charges on which he was condemned were that he did not believe
in the Gods of the established religion, that he introduced new Gods,
and that he corrupted the young: -the last charge probably referring
to the fact that Socrates freely pointed out the faults of the Athenian
constitution, and that many of his disciples took the anti-popular
side (N. D. 11 18, 167).

Our authorities for the life of Socrates are the writings of his
two disciples, Xenophon and Plato. The former (440-355 ne.)
was a soldier and country gentleman with a taste for literature, who
endeavoured to clear his master²s memory from the imputation of
impiety and immorality by publishing the Memorabilia, a collection
of his noteworthy sayings and discourses. Xenophon was banished
from Athens for fighting in the Spartan ranke at Coronea. Plato
is distinguished from the other disciples of Socrates as the one who
represents most truly the many-sidedness of his master, completing
indeed and developing what was defective in him and incorporating
all that was valuable iu the earlier philosophers. Before treating

of him it will be convenient to speak shortly of the ‘imperfect ’ or
one-sided Socraticists.
