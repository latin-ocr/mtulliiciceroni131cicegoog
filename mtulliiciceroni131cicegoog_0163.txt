ξ 20. sed ina palmaria: ‘but the prins for absurdityis duetowhat
we have still to notice ’. Pal. has the same ironical force in the only other
passageinwhiohitisusedbyo.oodillaaatuapdnmiquzilauts. It
has been vainly sought to defend the us reading palmari· by a reference to
the εσηεωιτίω of ᾗ 18. On the use of the plural where only one proposition
follows, we may say with Sch. that it may be intended to imply Plato's
expression of the same thought under various forms (e. g. Tim. 32 ο, 33 Δ,
41 Δ), or we may be satisfied with the more general explanation given by
Madv. (in Orelli), ‘aza Otberopomit tanquam plara eadem orationisfiqura

quod qui introduxerit 18 dixerit: Heind. followed by Ο. F. Mtiller
Pref. Π objects to the Subj. dixerit which Draeger explains (ξ 151 bb) as
an atti-action to the pmoeding eumdum-it. 1 should be disposed to
regard it as an instance of the ordinary confusion by which the verb of
saying is put in Subj. instead of the thing said (Roby §§ 1742, 1746).
Omitting diberit we should necessarily have had mnpiternm fictum ait to
show that this was a supposition of Plato’s.

manu paene factum: seenon§4sabricatipaene.

primis labi-Is gustasse: ‘to have the slightest teste οῖ’, lit. ‘with the
suriaco of the lips’, pn'mm being used in a sort of restrictive apposition to
express not the first of a number of similar things, but the foremost part of
one thing, as Fam 111 Bprima provincia ‘the nearest partos theprovince',
Catull. 11 3 primm digitur ‘ the tip of the finger'. The more common form
in this use is pimeni«, cf. De Orat. 1 87 primoribus labris attinyere. Simi-

ἄκρου χείλους φιλοσοφεῖν.

physiolouam: ‘ natural philosophy’ including theology, according to
the Stoice and Epicuream, but distinguished from it by Aristotle. Heind.
following Manutius omitted the explanatory clause (nat. rat.) as a gloss,
but Klotz (Δώη. Urit. Π 5) successfully defends it by a large induction of
passages, e.g. the explanation of the same word Div. 1 90, of πρόληψις N. D.

quod ortum—aeternum. So Tmo. 1 79 vult enim, quod nemo usqae,
quiquid natum sit interire. This principle is often asserted by Plato, as
in step. vm 546 A, Phaedrus 245 c D (translated by U. Tusa. 1 53), where itis
