ANALvsls or Boox 1. xxxix

Ca. Cotta commences his reply with an expression of his belief
in the existence of the Gods, but holds it impossible to arr-ive at any
certainty with regard to the divine nature. ΠΙ 57-—xxn 61.

Ob. Weakness of the argument derived from universal consent.
Negatively, such consent is unproved: positively, many have held a
contrary opinion. xxm 62—64.

Oc. ΤῙιθ atomio doctrine is opposed to science. If it were true
it would be inconsistent with the belief in the immortality of the

Gods. When Epicurus, by way of evading the difficulty, speaks of
quasi-corporeal Gods, he becomes unintelligible. xxm 65—xxvn 75.

Cd. Weakness of the argument in favour of anthropomorphism.
If the Gods present themselves to our eyes in human form only,

that is because our ancestors, whether from superstition or policy‚
established that belief among us3 elsewhere the caee is different. If
that form seems to men the most beautiful, that is merely the preju-
dice of race. If it is said that experience shows rationality to be
confined to that form, on the same ground we might attribute all the
properties of man to the Gods3 but reason shows the danger of
arguing from our limited experience‚ and it shows also that a body

which is suitable for man is unsuitable for such a being as God is
supposed to be. xxvn 76-xxxv11 102.

Ge. Even if we grant that there are such images as Epicurus
describes, what ground have we for thinking that there is any reality
corresponding to them? or, in any case, for supposing that they
reveal to us a blessed and immortal being? Immortality you think
proved by your doctrine of equilibrium, but the same doctrine would
prove the immortality of men. And how can beings be happy who
are without activity and therefore without virtue‘l As to pleasures
of sense they are worse off than men. All that can be predicated οἱ
them is absence of pain, yet even this is impossible since they must
be in constant fear of dissolution from the influx and efflux of atoms.
xxxvu 103—xm 114.

Cf. The Epicurean principles, if accepted, are fatal to religion.
What inducement is there to worship beings without activity and
without benevolence‘i Epicurus' profession of piety was merely a
blind to deceive the multitude. xm 115—xmv 124.
