is that the image exactly resembles the reality, cf. §81 folL, Zeller spic.

for mc ex of uss 3 to the same effect is Mr Reid's emendation given in the
note below. Mr Roby thinks the av forma of uss may be retained in the
sense ‘not cast by the form' ¹.

quo modo illi ergo ι ειο. incida-rom, ‘ how then (if there is no resem-
blance between the images and their originale) did the originale come into
my head‘l’

et quorum imagines. Allen considers the passage corrupt, as it has
been already stated that the images are those of Homer &a Ι think it
may be defended as asking for a nearer definition of the omnium above,
and so preparing the way for the question which follows: ‘when you say
omnium do you include, not only men now dead such as Plato, but imagi-
nary characters such as OrpheuS, or impossibilities such as the Chimaera ‘l ’
[Perhaps better as Mr Roby takes it: ‘ Cicero says, if images which you
say are Homer’s &a come, but are not like Homer's real form, then two
questions arise, lst how do the originale come to you at all‘l 2nd whose
are the images which do come‘l They are copied from some real form,

whose was that form? ²]

orpheum—fuisse. Cf. ξ 33 n.‚* Bernays’ Dialoye d. An‘st. p. 95,
Lobeck Aylaoph- p. 339. The reference is to the lost De philosophia, but
it is quite in accordance with the manner in which Arist. elsewhere alludes
to the Orphio poetae, ας. τὸ καλούμενα Ὀρφέως ἔπη An. 1 5 15 with Treu-
delenburg’s n. ς in commenting on which passage Philoponus says that A.
speaks doubtfully as to the authorship of the poema ὥς καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν τοῖς
περὶ φιλοσοφίας λέγει· αὐτοῦ μὲν γάρ εἶσι τὰ δόγματα· ταῦτα δέ φησιν Ὀνομά-
κριτον ἐν ἔπεσι κατατεῖναι. This differs from C.'s account, in recognizing the
existence of Orpheus and attributing certain doctrines to him‚ but there
seems no reason to doubt that C. is here correct.

hoc Orphicum carmen-oeream. Philop., as we have seen, names
Onomacritus, but, if Bernays is right in supposing that the lst book of the
Περὶ Φιλοσοφίας contained a general examination of the Orphic theology‚ it
