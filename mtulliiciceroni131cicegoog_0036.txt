and treatises of Plato, Aristotle, Theophrastus, Crantor, Carneades,
Panaetius, Antiochus, Posidonius, and others. In a word he was
confessed to be by far the most learned and accomplished of the
philosophioel amateurs of his time. As to the nature of his own
views‚ we shall be better able to form a judgment‚ if we look first at
the man and his position. Oicero was much more of a modern Italian
than of an ancient Roman. A mus homo, sprung from the Volscian
municipium of Arpinum, he had none of that proud, sels—centred
hardness and toughness of character which marked the Senator of
Rome. Nature had gifted him with the sensitive, idealistic tem-
perament of the artist and the orator, and this had been trained to
its highest pitch by the excellent education he had received. If he
had been less open to ideas, less many-sided‚ less sympathetic, less
conscientium, in a word, if he had been less human, he would have
been a worse man, he would have exercised a less potent influence

on the future of Western civilization, but he would have been a ⁶

stronger and more consistent politician, more respected no doubt by
the blood-and-iron school of his own day, as ofours. While his imagina-
tion pictured to him the glories of old Rome, and inflamed him with
the ambition of himself acting a Roman part, as in the matter of
Catiline‚ and in his j udgment of Caesar, and while therefore he ou
the whole espoused the cause of the Senate, as representing the his-
toric greatness of Rome, yet he is never fully convinced in his own
mind, never satisfied either with himself or with the party or the
persons with whom he is most closely allied. And this indecision of
his political views is reflected in his philosophy. Epicuream’sm indeed
he condemns, as heartily as he condemns Clodius or Antony: its
want of idealism‚ its prosaic regal-d for matter of fact, or rather its
exclusive regard for the lower fact to the neglect of the higher, its
aversion to public life, above all perhaps its contempt for literature
as such, were odious in his eyes. But neither is its rival quite to
his taste. While attracted by the lofty tone of its moral and re-
ligious teaching, he is repelled by its dogmatism, its extravagance
and its technicalities. Of the two remaining schools‚ the Peripatetic
had forgotten the more distinctive portion of the teaching of its
founder, until his writings were re·edited by Andronicus of Rhodes
(who strangely enough is never mentioned by Cicero, though he
must have been lecturing in Rome about the time of his consulship),
and it had dwindled accordingly into a colourless doctrine of eom-
mon, sense, of which Cicero speaks with respect indeed, but without
