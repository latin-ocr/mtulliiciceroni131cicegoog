violatum. Unless C. contravenes usage in* making faelem common,
we have here an ex. of agreement with the more remote word, as in Loq- 1

omission of esse see n. on doctus ξ 60.

mam vestram sospitam. The temple of J uno Sospita or Sispita,
‘ the Saviour’, at Lanuvium, was one of peculiar sanctity‚ being visited
annually ΒΥ the consuls like that of Jupiter Latiaris. Livy often speaks of
prodigies occurring there, and C. (Div. 1 99) tells us that the outbreak of
the Marsic war was signified ΒΥ mice gnawing the shields suspended there.
It was rebuilt in obedienoe to a vision no. 90 (Div. 1 4). For the special
ceremonies belonging to it see Art. on Lanuvium in Dice. of 0⁶09„ and
Preller Ro'm. Myth„ p. 246 ². For the atti-action quam Sospitam instead of
quam Sospita videtur cf. ξ 86 tam aperte quam te, and Zumpt ξ 603 Β.

cum pene—repandis Preller 1. c. quotes an inscription relating to a
priestess quae in aede Junomzs Sospitae Matris Reyime mutulam et
clypewm et kastam et calceos rite novavit voto. The Goddess appears in this '
garb on the coins of the Roscii and other families connected with Lanu·

. vium. See Miiller Am. Art. ξ 353. The goat-skin‚ which Preller oonsi-

ders to be a symbol of fertility, and connects with that worn by the
Luperci, covered the head and breast ; the actatum was oblong as opposed
to the round clypeus,- an engraving of the shoe with the upturned- toe,
calceolus repandus (pandus), is given in Rich's Comp. to Did. p. 993 Ι
think the diminutive implies a low shoe, not (as Rich) one worn by a
female, as we read of calcei muliebres in Varro L. L 1x 29 and elsewhere;
the hasta marks protection, it was also borne ΒΥ the J uno Curitis. Moser
(ms.) notices the recurrence of the termination -am seven times in ten words.

alia nobis: is added ΒΥ Ursinus, and seems required if the preceding
sentence is right, but Sch. Opuoe. 111. 287 denies the existence of a Romam
Juno distinguished as such by special attributea and thinks that nec Romana
may have been added by some reader who stumbled at the omission of any
reference to the Juno Capitolina, On the other hand Klotz Adn. oric. 1 6
proposes to insert alia Romani-s between Aryivis and alia Lanuvinis. It
seems to me that et quidem (on which see ξ 78 n.) comes in very naturally
with a repeated alia nobis, and the fact of the repetition facilitates the omis-
sion in the first instance. In speaking of the me Arqiva C.. no doubt had
in his mind the famous statue by Polyclitus, the contemporary and fellow-
pupil of Phidias. lt was made of ivory and gold, and represented the god-
dess seated on a throne, her head crowned with a garland‚ on which were
worked the Graces and the Hours, the one hand holding the symbolica-l
pomegranate, and the other a sceptre, surmounted by a cuckoo, a bird
sacred to Hera, on account of her having been once changed into that form
by Zeus (Pausan. 11 17 quoted in Dict. of B.). It does not appear that
