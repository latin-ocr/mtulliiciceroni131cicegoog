powers, these formed a whole unique in the history of the world ς
and we can well believe that they acted like an electric shock on
the more susceptible minds of his time. For we must remember
that Socrates did not, like earlier philosophers, content himself with
imparting the results of solitary meditation to a few favour-ed dis-
ciples: nor did he, like the Sophiste, lecture to a paying audience on
a set subject; but obeying, as he believed, a divine call, he mixed
with men of every class wherever they were to be found, cross-
questioning them as to the grounds of their beliefs, and endeavouring
to awaken in them a consciousness of their ignoranee and a desire
for real knowledge. His own account of his call is as follows:
one of his disciples was told by the Oracle at Delphi that Socrates
was the wisest of men. Socrates could not conceive how this should
be, as he was conscious only. οἰ ignorance3 but he determined to
question some of those who had the highest repnte for wisdom;

accordingly he went to statesmen and poets and oratore, and last
of all to craftsmen, but everywhere met with the same response:

none really knew what were the true ends of life, but each one
sancied that he knew, and most were angry when Socrates attempted
to disturb their illusion of knowledge. Thus he arrived at the
conclusion that what the oracle meant was that the first step to
knowledge was the consciousness of ignorance‚ and he believed, in
consequence of other divine warnings‚ that it was his special mission
to bring men to this consciousness.

'I'he next step on the way to knowledge was to get clear general
notione, by comparing a number of speeific cases in which the same
general term was employed; or, according to the phraseology of
ancient philosophy, to see the One (the kind or genus, the general
principle, the law, the idea,) in the Many (the subordinate species or
individuale, the particulare, the phenomena, the facts) and conversely
to rise from the Many to the One. The process of doing this he
called Dialectic, i. e. ‹limem-se, since it was by question and answer
that he believed the proposed definition could be best teswd, and
the universal idea which was latent in each individual could be
brought to light. Truth and right were the same for all: it was
only ignorance‚ mistake, confusion which made them seem different
to different men. And similarly it is ignorance which leads men
to commit vicious actions: no one willingly does wrong, since to
do right is the only way to happiness, and every man desires
happiness. Thus virtue is a knowledge of the way to happiness,
