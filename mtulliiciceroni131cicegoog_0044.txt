xliv Immune-1⁸10&

the year 1810 a volume of Herculanemia, edited by Drummond and
Walpole, was published in London. This contained an anonymous
fragment, twelve columns in length, entitled by the editors περὶ τῶν
θεῶν. The fragment excited considerable interest owing to the resem-
blances it presented to parts of the speech of Velleius in the first

book of the N. D„ and it was ably reviewed in the Qum-terlff and
Edinbwqh during the course of the year. Hayter wrote a reply
to the former in the same year, speaking of the book as Φαίδρου περὶ
θεῶν. The same authorship had been already claimed for it by Mfirr,
in a German translation of Philodemus περὶ μουσικῆς (Berlin, 1806),
in which he announced that among the forthcoming Herculanean
publications there was a treatise entitled Φαίδρου περὶ φύσεως θεῶν,
which had been made use of by Cicero for his own work on the
same subject. Hayter allows that the name Philodemus would
naturally suggest itself, but he says the space does not admit of
reading so many letters. An improved text with notes was brought
out in 1833 by Petersen at Hamburg‚ under the title Phaedri
Epicurei, vulqo oenonfflni Rev-cummis, de Natura Deorwm.. He
uses the following arguments to show that Phaedrus must be the
author. Since Cicero’s chief instructors in the doctrines of Epicurus
were Zeno and Phaedrus, both of whom are prominently mentioned
in the N. D„ it is natural to suppose that he must have borrowed
from one or the other. And as Phaedrus is spoken of in terms of
warmer praise (see ἓ 93) he seems the more likely of the two 3 besides
Zeno (ἕ 94) is said to have attacked his own contemporaries, whereas
the latest writer criticized in the speech of Velleius is Diogenes of
Babylon, who died not later than 150 ne. The strongest argument
however in favour of Phaedrus is, that in a letter to Atticus (xm 43),
written about the time of the composition of the N. D., Cicero asks
to have his treatises περὶ θεῶν et περὶ Παλλάδος’ sent to him; just
as in 1111 8 he asks for Panaetius περὶ προνοίας, which we know to
have been used by him in N. D. 11 118, De Divin. 1 6, 12, 11 88;

² 'l'he older reading is Φαίδρου περισσῶν et Ἑλλάδος, which was supposed to
refer to two books of Dicaearchus, Ο. having asked for other writings of his in
earlier letters. It was suggested that the former treatise might be a crificism
of the Phaedrus of Plato, which D. is known to have condemned as too ornate;
while the latter was identified with the βίος Ἑλλάδος of which some &agments
still remain-
