eam 0ωο causam—putaremus. Madv. thinks that this clause was
added by a reader who misunderstood the construction mirum εἰ (5) and it
has accordingly been bracketed by later editors. The objections as stated
by Sch. Opem 111 317 foll. are (1) that it is superfluous in sense; we had
already been told that man’s sels-admiration was one 01· the grounds of
anthropomorphism ; (2) that in reading the sentence, we naturally take εἰ as
depending on mimm, and it causes an awkward surprise when we find that
it is intended for the protasis of the sentence; (3) 11101 1110 sequence of
tenses is violated by putaremus after cue. KL (Adn. Oris. 111 7) defends
the uss reading, and 1 am inclined to think 110 is right. The clause may
be superfluous in reference to what precedes, but if we look to the follow·
ing sentence, we shall see that it is needed in order to explain the intro-
duction of εἰ ratio acet. Cicero is seeking to prove that the reason why
man attributes his own form to the gods whom he worships, is because

110, 111 common with other animale, loves his own form best; and he pro-
ceeds to argue that this common incident of animal nature would, if acted

upon by reason, lead the other animals each to glorify (plurimum tribu·
turae> his own nature in like manner, cf. the passage stom Xenophanes
quoted below. If there is any corruption in the tert, one might suggest
the loss of a sentence referring to the 3rd reason for anthropomorphism
(domicilium nmis). At present this is passed over without notice, and
Ο. returns to the first reason in §§ 81—85, only introducing the 3rd in
ξ 87 mixed up there with another argument from experience. As to the
21111 objection, there is no doubt a slight awkwardness in separating εἰ
from mirum, but this is certainly not a fatal objection to the correctness of
the sentence. Or it might be possible to take εἰ as depending on mirum,
and then to suppose the construction broken, eam σεεσ causam being in-
troduced as a sort of epexegetic clause, also dependent on mirum. Such
0 change of construction might be compared with that after facit ξ 31
fim't Soc. disputantem eundemque dicere, after dicemus ξ 75 illud non eat
...εἰσ rem esee, after docere ξ 76. Thirdly the tense ofputaremm is attmcted
to praesumpsit, as in Lael. 2 memini-sta...qu esset querela, where the
tense is attracted to an intermediate Imperii, see Draeg. ξ 151 5 c, and
Roby ξ 1517. For the atti-action of the pronoun (eam for id) see ξ 67
and Roby ξ 1068.

Ch. xxvm ξ 78. qnid censes...non tributum fuisse? An abbre-v
viated expression for quid cemes? mmm cemes? cf. ξ 82 quid iqt'twr
omues? Apim 810, Zumpt ξ 769, Beier on Off. 11 25. On the thought cf.
Xenophanes (Zeller 1⁴ p. 490) ἄλλ’ εἶτ-ὀι χεῖρας γ’ εἶχον βόες ἠὲ λέοντες, Ι
ἢ γράψω χείρεσσι καὶ ἔργα τελεῖν ὅπερ ἄνδρες, Ι καί κε θεῶν Ζδίας ἔγραφον καὶ

ascribed to Metrodorus (II. V. VI pt. 2 001. xiii) we find the same objection
