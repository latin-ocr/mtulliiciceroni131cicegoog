Any one who will take the trouble to compare the text of the
N. D„ as it now stands, with the text of the earlier editions from the
Ed. Pr. of 1471 to the an’orum Ed. of 1818 will be astonished at
the improvement which has been effected‚ owing in great part to
judieious emendations by successive generations of scholare. The
value and even the necessity of conjecture, as a means of restoring
the text of this, as of other ancient writings‚ is sufficiently shown
by the readings cited under the last head, but it may be proved even
more conclusively by reference to other passages, which did not
admit of the 661116 brevity and simplicity of statement, such as 5 24
quodque in deo, 5 25 si di poesuoeit, 5 65 nihil est enim, in which it is
confessed that the present text is wrong, though editors are not
agreed on the right mode of restoring the true text. Whilst I 6111
upon this subject, it may be well to give a few illustratione from
the present book, of the commonet· sources of corruption in MSS,
*so as to assist my younger readers in judging of the admissibility of
any proposed emendation. The illustrations are taken from the
various readings in Orelli's edition 66 well as from my own. I make
no attempt at an exhaustive analysis‚ but simply group together
examples of similar confusion. ,
