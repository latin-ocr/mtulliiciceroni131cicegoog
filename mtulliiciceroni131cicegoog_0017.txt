the constituent atoma, the mode of arrangement, and the larger or
811181101- amount of 1801111111 separating the 8101118. Thus Soul, the
divine element pervading the world, 18 8 eort of fire made up of
small, round, smooth atoms in continual motion, and largely mixed
with vacuum. The account given by Democritus of the origin of
the existing universe 18 that there were, to begin with, 811 infinite
number of atoms carried downwards by their own inherent gravity
at different rates in proportion to their magnitude, that thus they
impinged one upon another, and gave rise to 811 sorte of oblique and
contrary movementS, out of which 1188 generated 811 all-absorbing
rotatory motion or vortex. Under these various movements cor-
responding 8101118 found their fitting places and became entangled
and hooked together 8ο 88 to form bodieS. Thus the earthy and
watery particles were drawn to the centre where they remained at
rest, while the airy and fiery rebouuded from them and rose to the
circumference, forming 8 sort of shell between the organized world
and the infinitude of unorganized atoma on the outside. There was
811 011111088 number of 811011 worlds in various stages of growth or
decay under the influx or efflux of atoms3 the destruction of each
world followed upon its collision with another world.

>The account given of the mind and its operatione was 88
follows z—Particles of mind or 80111 were distributed throughout the
body, and were continually escaping owing to their subtle nature,
but, 88 they escaped, their place was taken by other particlee 1111181οᾶ

actual contact with atoma 88 111 1110 cese of tante and hearing, or by
11118308 thrown off from bodies external‘to 118, and entering in through
the poree.

These 11118308 were 8 kind of film consisting of the surface atoma
which were continually floating off from 811 bodies without any
disturbance of their mutual order, and were, 80 to speak, 8 sample
of the object from which they were detached. Democritus 8180 used
the same word (εἴδωλα) for the anthropomorphic combinatione of the
fineet seul-atoma which he believed to exist in the air, and to be
at times perceived by men. These were the Gods of the popular
relig-ion, not immortal, though longer lived' than men: some were
friendly, 801110 malignant3 he prayed that he might himself only meet
with the former. Of. N. D. 1 29 <iz 120.
