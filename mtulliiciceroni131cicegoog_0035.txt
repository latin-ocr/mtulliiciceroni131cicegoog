GREEK PHILOSOPHY. XXXV

And he pleased himself with the thought that he might find in the
Gods a pattern of the true philosophic life. Perfect happiness, im-
mortality and human shape were of the 00001100 of this πρόληψις.
Ηο000 he inserted that they must be composed of the finest atoms
and enjoy 01011101 1011000 in the vacant spaces between the worlds,
undisturbed by those labours of sustaining and superintending the
universe which were ascribed to them by other schools, as well as
by the popular religion (N. D. 1 43-56). Such Gods were worthy
of the worship and the imitation of the philosophers. On the nature
of the 00111 and the manner in which it receives its impressions by
images from without, Epicurus follows Democritus.

While the 01111001 doctrines of Epicurus are mainly the same 00
111000 of Aristippus, he differs from him in attaching more value to
permanent tranquillity than to momentary gratification‚ and also 111
preferring mental pleasures to bodily, as stronger and more enduring.
Virtue is desirable as the means to attain pleasure. The wise man,
i. 0. 1110 virtuous man, is happy because he is free from the fears of
the Gods and of death, because he has learnt to moderate his 1100010110
0οᾱ desii-es, because he knows how to estimate and compare pleasures
and 110100 so 00 10 0001110 the largest amount of the former with the
least of the latter. The distinction between right and wrong rests
merely 00 utility and has nothing myster-icus about it. One chief
means of attaining pleasure is the society of friends. 'l'o enjoy this
we should cultivate the feelings of kindness and benevolence.

The four last mentioned schools‚ i. 0. the Academy, the Lyceum,
the Porch and the Garden were, and bad long been, the only recognized
schools at the time whffen Cicero was growing up to manhood. Cicero
was personally acquainted with the most distinguished living repre-
sentatives of each. In his 19111 year, 00. 88, 110 had studied under
Phaedrum the Epicurean affl Philo tho Academio at Rom0; in his
28111 year, Β. c. 7 9, he attended the lectures of the Epicureans Phaedrus
and Zen0, as well as of Antiochus, the eclectio Academic, at Athens, “
and in the following year those of Posidonius, the eclectic Stoic,
at Rhodes. Diodotus the Stoic was for many years the honoured
inmate of his house. He had also a high esteem for the Peripatetic
Cratippus, whom he selected as the tutor for his son at, what we may
0011, 1110 University of Athens, Nor did he only attend lectures:
his letters show that ‘he was a great reader of philosophical books,
and he left behind him translations 01 adaptations of various dialogues
