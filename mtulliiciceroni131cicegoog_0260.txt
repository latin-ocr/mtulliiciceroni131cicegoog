in pontificiis, sc. libr-220, cf. the similar ellipse with annales. The pon-
tifical records included nine different kinds of books, according to Mar-
quardt Hb. d. Ro‘m. Alc. v1 p. 287 .· one of these consisted of indigitamenta,
forms of prayer, of which Augustino says (J. D. Π 8 nomina deorum aut
dearum, quac ali yramdibm voluminibus vix comprehendere potuerim, εἰπ-
mdis rebus propria dispertientes officia numinum. Sch. quotes Serv. ad
Geor-9. 1 21 nomina haec numinum in Indiqitanoentis inveniamur, id ωε in
libris pomficdibm5 qui et ommim deorum et rationem ipsorwn nominum
continent (e. g. Occator, Samtor, Sterczdinim).

innumerabilis· i.e. in the Epicurean viem cf. §§ 49, 50 and 53. So
Philod. p. 84⁸ The Epicuream believe that the gods οὔ μόνον ὅσους· φασὶν
οἱ Πανέλληνες ἀλλὰ καὶ πλείονας εἶναι)

istud-ita: Sch. quotes Div. 11 21 quod certe vobis ita dicendum cst.
and refers to Hand. Ture. 111 485. See also Madv. F'in. 11 17 and quod ita
just below. Ita is not merely pleonastic but adds precision 3 indeed in this
place I should prefer ιο give it a more distinct force ‘ that doctrine of
yours (una facie-⁹ ξ 80) requires such a corollary (eine nominibus), for what
is the good of a multitude of names where there is but one form’? [We

confiteri nescire: ‘ If the subject in an Ace. with Inf. is a personal or
reflexive pronoun referring to the subject of the principal verb, this pronoun
is sometimes left out with verba declarandi et putandi esp. when one Int· is
dependent upon another having the same subj ect' Madv. ξ 401, cf. Roby§ 1346

nauseare: Forcellini and Freund take this to mean ‘ to utter ἐ the
former compares Phil. v 20 orationem ore impurissimo evomuz‘t, and Fam.
111 25 vinolentum fwrorem effunderet. As both passages refer ιο Antony,
(of whom nauseo is also used in its literal sense 2 Pan. 84, and Fam. ζα.
quem eqo ructantem et museamem conjeci in Octaviani playa), there is some
excuse for violence of language there: here, in a quiet discussion with a
friend, such a use of the term (even if possible elsewhere, which Ι doubt‚)
seems almost beyond Roman bad taste. May it not mean ‘ to feel disgust
at having to utter such nonsense ' as Epicurus puts in your mouth? So
Hcind. takes it, and would even omit the following words as a gloss.
Phaedrus Π 6 25 has εἰ qm· stulte nauseant of over-critical readers who are
disgusted with everything, which Lewis and Short wrongly translate ‘ ιο
cause diegust'3 (the reading is however doubtful).
