ξ 37 Aristo: of Chios (Krische 404—415) represents a Cynic reec-
tion in the Stoio school 3 he confined himself exclusively to ethice on the
ground that logio was a spider's web, curicus but useless, and that physioe
were beyond our faculties t Stob. Flora. 80, 7 πρὸς ἡμᾶς μὲν εἶναι τὰ riensi,
μὴ πρὸς ἡμᾶς τὰ διαλεκτικά· μὴ γὰρ συμβάλλεσθαι πρὸς· ἐπανόρθωσιν βίον· ὑπὲρ
ἡμᾶς δι’ τὰ φυσικά· ἀδύνατα γὰρ ἐγνῶσθαι καὶ οὐδὲ παρέχειν χρείαν. It is
therefore probably correct, though we have no actual confirmation from
other sources, that he denied the possibility of our knowing anything about
God. The particular form given to the denial is of course due to the
Epicurean repertor.

Cleanthes: Krische 415—436. He is referred to N. D. 11 13, 111 16
(the four grounds of religious belief) 11 24 and 40 (all-pervading heat) 11 63,
‘111 63 (allegorical interpretation). Cleanthes is more distinguished for
moral strength and religious earnestness than for any speculative advanee:
none of the doctrines here mentioned are peculiar to him: one in fact is
Wrongly ascrioed to him. While holding with the rest of his school that
the universe was divine in virtue of the aetherial soul by which it was
animated, he placed the source and seat of aether in the sun, and not as
the others (agreeing with Aristotle) in the furthest heaven, cf. Aa 11 126
Zenoni et reliquis sere Stoicis aether videtur summus dett«, niente praeditus
qua omnia reqamur ,- Cleanthes, qui qzlasi majorum est qentium Stoicus,
solem dominari et rerum potiri putat ; Stob. Ed. 1 21 Κλ. ἐν ἡλίῳ ἔφησεν
εἶναι τὸ ἡγεμονικὸν τοῦ κόσμου.

extremum: to be taken predicatively with cingentem, ‘ inclosing on the
outside! ⁸

qui—nominetur. Heind. prefers the Ind. considering that this is an
addition of the reporter's, and not a part of the speech reported; but the
Subj. is an exact translation of such a speech as we find Diog. L. vn 137
λέγει Ζήνων ἀνωτάτω μὲν εἶναι τὸ πῦρ, δ δὴ αἰθέρα καλεῖσθαι, ἐν ᾧ πρός-ην τὴν
τῶν α’πλανῶν σφαῖραν γεννᾶσθαι, εἶτα τὴν τῶν πλανωμένων. 038 own view is
nearly the same Rep. VI 17 novem tibi orbibus conexa swa: omnia, quorum
unus est caelestia, extimus qui relz’quoe omnes complectitur, summus ipse deus
arcem et continens ceteros.

quasi delirans—voluptatem. The word del. is properly used of
dotage‚ as in δεῆσαι. 11 ista seniles amaia quae deliratio appellari solet.-
so anua delira Div. 11 141, Tunc. 1 48. For the tropical use see ξ 42.
Vell. waxes vehement as he thinks of the attaek made upon the Epicureans
in Ole.’s treatise περὶ ἡδονῆς Diog. L. vn 37, 175.

fingit formam quandam : this probably refers to the anthropomorphie
language used by Cle. in speaking of God, as in the grand hymn ’ω Zeus,
τοῖον ἔχεις ὖπόεργον ἀνικήτοις ε’νὶ χερσὶν Ι ἆμφήκη, πυρόεντα, ciusdem
κεραυνόν. In such words Cle. gives, as it were (quandam, cf. n. on quadam
ξ 33) a human form (cf. nulla species ξ 34) to Zeus.

divinitatem omnem: ‘ complete divinity’3 omnio qualitative, not
quantitative.
