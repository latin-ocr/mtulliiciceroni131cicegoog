μήτε τῆς ἆφθαρσίας ἆλλότριον μήτε τῆς· μακαριότητος πρόσαπτε· πᾶν δὲ τὸ
φυλάττειν αὐτοῦ δυνάμενον τὴν μετὰ ἀφθαρσίας μακαριότητα περὶ αὐτὸν
δόξαζε). All opinions which are inconsistent with this are ridiculed as
absurdities ε as we read in Philodemus¹ p. 96 ‘the Epicureans condemn all
who differ from them ds· ἂν ὑπεναντία τῇ προλήψει δογματιζόντυν’. F urther
there is no attempt at aecuracy in giving the opinions of the earlier
philomphers: rather they are intentionally caricatuned in order ιο make

them more open ιο attack. Ο. in fact has put into the mouth of Vell. a g

speech suitable to his own description of the Epicurean mode of con-
troversy; fidenter eane, ut colent isti, nihil tam verens quam m dubitare
alt'quadereoidereturMD. 118, vem-aeolumleqicis‚ vestr-amatis, oetam
eam ineoqnaa condemnatis (spoken by Balbus N. D. 11 73). If Cotta
afterwards praises the speech (ut tu, detineto, ‘qv-avim, ornate ξ 69;
enumerasti memoriter ot copiae, ut maai quidem admirari luberet in homine
use Romano tantam amentiam, mque α Thale philosophorum sententiae
ξ 91 ,) this is a part of hiswell-known courtesy (comiter ut solebat 557).
How far the inaccuracies of the speech are to be attributed to C. himself
or ιο his Epicurean authorities is discussed in the Imroduotion. Minucius
(c. 19) gives a summai-y of this section ιο prove an opposite conclusion, vis.
that all philosophers agree in asserting that God exists and that he is a
spirit, cf. §42 n.

qualia vero—repetam. The text is uncertain, and presente difficulties ‚
whichever reading we adopt. If we insert alia after vero with two of
Orelli's uss, this is in the first place hardly a suitable term for what
promises to be an exhaustive disquisition on the earlier systems (ab ultimo
repetam„ Sch- therefore (Opino. 111 305 and 359) would prefer either to
read cetera for alia, or ιο transfer asperiorum with Doderleim placing it
before ab ultimo, which would then be taken absolutely as in Invent. 1 28
brev& erit, si unde neeesse est, inde initium clametur, et non ab ultimo
repetem-,- and, in the second place, all these readings are inconsistent with
the fact that a large part of the subsequent polemio is directed against
the Stoice. 1 am inclined therefore to retain the old reading, translating
‘Such is a general statement of the Stoic doctrines: Ι will now prooeed
to show how they are related, to the older philosophies' 3 more literally
⁸ to show what their character- is, I will trace back their history ιο its
eqliest source '. Probably there may have been some Stoic history of
philosophy professing to show that their doctrines were substantially the
same as those held by the most esteemed of the earlier philosophers. The
Epicuream would meet this by endeavouring to prove that such support
could only damage their cause. Fortsch (Quam. Pulc. 1837) explains it
differently, cuju vero generis sint, ita nunc octmdam ut exordiar ab ultimo
superiorem, ie. ea quedem ymeri-3 esee, ita nilzai esse ‚· but Vell. has been
proving that the Stoic doctrines nihili ease for the last page or more.
