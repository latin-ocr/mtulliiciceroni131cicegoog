have been identified with God, since we learn from Aristotle (Phys. 111 4) ·

that A. considemd this to be τὸ θεῖον and* to govern (κυβερνᾶν) all things.-
True, the ἄπειρον was impersonal, but so was flamm and therefore Augus-
fine (0. D. vm 2) is justified in saying that neither A. nor Thales were
theists in the proper sense. It seems however that later writers gave a
more mechanical aspect to the physical theory of Anaximander, which
they regarded as differing from that of Anaxagoras only in the fact that
the latter recognized »052 where the former had seen only an ἀίδιος κίνησις,
cf. Ritter and Preller ξ 18 foll. with the notes from the Aristotelian com-
mentatore. So Plutarch (Plac. Pan. 1 3, 4) finds fault with Anaximander,
but not with Thales, for making no mention of an efficient cause.

οὐρανούς θεούς, and Plut. Plac. Pha. 1 7 τοὺς ἀστέρας οὐρανίους θεούς, cf.
Zeller 1⁴ 211. The words orientes metuentesque are ιο be understood of
the worlds which are continually being evolved out of the ὄπειρον and
again absorbed into it.

supposition being opposed ιο the Epicurean πρόληψις, cf. ξ 43, and on this

περιέχει. Stobaeus (Ed. 1 56) further tells us that he gave th‘e name of
God to Air, and he adds the explanation that when the elements are thus
deified we must understand that divinity is attributed ιο the power which
has its seat in the clement. How then are we to account for C's extra-
ordinary assertion that the air from which all things proceed and into
which they are absorbed is not itself eternal, but had a beginning in time
(qiqnzss Kr. p. 55 holds that it arisee from a confusion between the divine
air and the subordinate Gods who are produced from this air: a more
probable suggestion might be that it is a misunderstanding of the Greek,
ἀὴρ πάντα γίγνεται ‘pasees into all forms'. [Mr Reid indeed thinks C. meant

consistent with the following quod ortum cia] 1 believe that C. is here
