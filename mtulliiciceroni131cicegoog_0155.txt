injussu, coactae, concessu. On its relation to aecer-situ see Wilkins in Jowmc
of Ρήιῖοῑοργ, no. ΧΠ. p. 278.

offendi: ‘ found ², lit. ‘ stumbled across ’.

exedra: ‘saloon', lit. ‘a sitting out', used not so much, 1 think, of
‘ out-of·door seats' (D. os Ant.) as of bays or projections from a central
hall or court (περιπόλων), which were sometimes very small (Guhl and K.
ξ 80) but more frequently of considerable size with semicircular apses and
stone seats along the walls. Vitruvius in his description of the palaestra
or yynmaeim such as were attached to Roman villas of the higher class
(Act. 1 4, Fam. vn 23, De Orat. 1 98, Divin. 1 8) recommends that in three
of the clois‘oers surrounding the court there should be exechae epasz'osae in
quibus philogophi, rhetores, reliquique qui studiis delectantur sedentes dis-
putare poesim v 11. (Readers of Plato will remember that he places the
scene of several of his Dialogues in the Palaestra..) For the use of the
word in ecclesiastical writers cf. Bingham Bk. vm c. v. ξ 4, and c. vi. ξ 9,
c. vii. ξ 1. Ο. uses the word De Orat. 111 17, En. v 4, and the diminutive
exodo-ium Fam. vn 23. For the spelling (exedra or exhedra) see Sch.’s n.
with the reff.

ad quem: C. often uses ad after desem, otherwise the Dat. would have
seemed more appropriate to express honour done to a person, cf. Draeg.

primas: sc. panes, πρωταγωνιστεῖν, 8 metaphor from the stage frequently
used with agere, ferre, dare, concedere, tenere, &a Secundae issimilarly

ch. vn. ξ 16. Piso: M. Pupius Piso Calpurnianus consul in no. 61. We
leam from Asconius that Ο. in his youth was taken to him by his father
to receive instruction in oratory. His style of eloquence is described in
the Brutus ξ 236, where he is said to have been mxime munium qui ante
fuerunt Graecis litteriis eruditus. He was instructed in the Peripatetio
philoeophy by Staseas (De Orat. 1 104) and is introduced as the spokesman
of that school, as modified by Antiochus, in the oth bk. of the De mntem.
As consul he deeply offended Ο. by favouring Clodius. In the letters written
to Atticus about that time heis spoken of as one a quo nihil operes boni rei
publicaequia non vult‚· πίΙιτΖ muas maliquia non audet,Act.113; uno
vitio mium vitiosus quod inere, quod somni plenus, 1 14. He died be-
fore the writing of the N. D. as is shown by Aa. 1111 19. Krische p. 19
thinks that O.'s reason for omitting the Peripatetio school was the
obscurity of Aristotle's teaohing on the points which are here discussed.
A more probable reason is that on these points he accepted Antiochus‘
identification of the Stoic with the Platonic and Aristotelian philosophy
(ξ 33) and thought it unnecessary to treat separately of the latter.
