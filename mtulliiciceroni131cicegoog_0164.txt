distinctly stated that that alone is eternal which has in itself the principle
of sels-movemenig ὅτε οὐκ ἀπολεῖπον ἑαυτό, while that which is moved by
another (life being regarded as a species of movement) cea-ses to live when
it ceases to be moved‚ and is therefore in itself mortal. What is cotn-
pounded is especially liable to this law, see Tim. 41 A τὸ δεθὲν πᾶν λυτάν,
apd Phaedo 78 0 τῷ μὲν ξυνθετῷ ὅντι φύσει προσήκει τοῦτο πάσχειν,
διαιρεθῆναι ταύτῃ ᾗπερ Eunoen-idq· εἷ δέ τι τυγχάνει ὃν ,ἀξύνθετον τούτῳ
μόνῳ προσήκει μὴ πάσχειν τοῦτο. How then does the universe being oom-
pounded and receiving its principle of movement from without, and them-
fore essentially mortal, escape dissolutioni Because the First-Mover and
Compounder eternally wills to keep it together as a living unity, and his
will is stronger than any band, Tim. :32 o, 33 Δ, 41 Δ Β. This Platonic
principle is of course the only ground for the Christian belief in the con-
tinuance of any created existence. Bp. Butler, it is true, in defending the
doctrine of Immortality against the Materialists (And. ch. 1) makes use of
the argument from indiscerptibility; but this is only to show that, even
suppomg the soul material, it need not necessarily· perish in death, of
which the only known effect is to dissolve what is dissoluble: he is faa·
from maintaining, as some have done, that each individual soul possessos
an inherent immortality a priori, so as to render its extinction impossible
even to the Almighty. The argument here used by Velleius is taken from
Aristotle De Caelo 1 10 where he maintains the eternity'of the universe in
opposition to the Platonic doctrine of creation„ [Of. for the whole passage

cujus principium aliquod sit, nihil sit extremum: ‘such as to have
a beginning without having an end’. An example of adversative asyndeton
equivalent to the opposition of clauses by the use of μέν and ’δέ in Greek ς
see just below sapientes lmiant, stulti nec m'tare possint. In both instances “
the first clause⁸ is introductory to the second and would be unmeaning
without it. For other examples of coordinate propositione, where we
should have expected one proposition to be subordinated to the other, see
ξ 23, Roby 5 1027, Nagels. ξ 160, Madv. ξ 438, and his Gr. Gr. ξ 189 b,
also indices (under σοον-ά.) to Mayor’s edd. of Juvenal and the Second Pla·-
lzppic of O. Logically such clauses would come under the head conjunc-

si est eadem: ‘if your Pronoea is the same, then I want to know all
I asked about before, the agentsjengines, &03 There does not seem to be
any need to insert a second eadem, to be the object of requiro, as most of
the recent edd. have done (see Sch. Opaca. 111 283). Klotz, on the other
hand, retaining the ns reading, makes vestra predicative‚ which gives no
meaning, for there has been no allusion to any but the Stoic Pronoea, who
is here compared with the Platonic Demiurgus. The difference between
