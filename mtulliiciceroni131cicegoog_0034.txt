in all other cases. Epicurus himself dces not seem ιο have carried
his logical investigatione further than this.

The only reason for studying physice was to free the soul from
superstitious fears, and with this view ιο prove that the constitu ‘ n
of the universe might be explained from mechanical cataste
two main principles asserted by Epicurus were that noth' g could
be prcduoed out of nothing, and that what exists cannot become
non-existent. From these principles he deduced the truth of the
atomio system, differing however from Democritus in one important
point, viz. in his explanation of the manner in which the atoms
were brought together. Democritus had asserted that the heavier
atcms overtook the lighter in their downward course, and thus
initiamd the collisicn which finally resulted in a general vortical
movement. Epicurus retaining the same crude view of ‘up' and ‘down’
held that each atcm mcved with equal speed and that they could
only meet by the inherent sels-movement cf the atoms, which enabled
them to swerve from the rigid vertical line, and he found a confir-
mation cf this indeterminate movement of the atoms in the free will
of man. In other respects there is little difference between the
physical views of Democritus and Epicurus. Both held that there
were innumerable worlds continually coming into being and passing
out of being in the infinitude of space. As to subordinate arrange-
ments Epicurus thought it unnecessary and indeed impossible ιο
assign any one theory as certain. It was enough if we could imagine
theories which were not palpably inadmissible, and which enabled us
to dispense with any supernatural cause. Nor was it at all necessary
to suppose that the same phenomenon, e. g. sunrise, always proceeded
from the same cause. The existence of the present race of animals
was explained, ss it had been by Empedocles, on a rude Darwinian
hypothesis. Out of the innumerable combinaticns of atoms which
had been tried throughout the infinite ages of the past, those only
survived which were found to be suited ιο their envircnment. The
eye was not made to see with, but being made by the fortuitous
concourse of atoms it was found on trial to have the property cf
seeing. But though denying in the strongest terms any creative
or governing Reason‚ Epicurus did not object to Gods who did not
interfere with the world or with man. On the contrary he held
that the universality of the belief in Gods proved that such belief
was based upon a primary notion, a real πρόληψις, though it had
been corrupted by the admixture of idle imaginatione, ὑπολήψεις.
