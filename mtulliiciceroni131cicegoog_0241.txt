their logical refinements and were especially distinguished by the name
dialectici, called it α’ξίωμα διεζευγμένον, thus explained by Diog. L. vn 72
διεζευγμένον ἐστὶν ὃ ὑπὸ τοῦ “afron '² διαζευκτικοῦ συνδέσμου (‘ disjunctive con-
junction') διέζευκται, οἷον “ἤτοι ἡμέρα ἐστὶν ἢ νύξ furtu? δπαγγέλλεται δὲ ὁ

pertimuit ne—fleret necessarium. The Stoioe held that their prin-
ciple of Necessity was involved in the Disjunctive judgment applied to
future events, as may be seen argued at length in Fac. 20 folL, e. g. Since
it is absolutely necessary that a man now living must at a given date in
the future be either dead ‚or alive, whichever of the two proves eventually
to be true must be now a necessary truth though unknown to us ; or, more
shortly, his existence or non-existence at that date is a necessary truth3
which of the two it is, will be made apparent by the event. Aristotle dis„
cussed the point in his treatise De Imerpret'atione ch. 9 foll. ‘ in regard to
the present or past, affirmative or negative judgments of existence are
necessarily true or false; but it is not so with regard to the future,
otherwise all future events would be fixed by necessity (ὥστε εἰ ἐν ἅπαντι
χρόνῳ οὕτως εἶχεν ὥστε τὸ ἕτερον ἀληθεύεσθαι, ἀναγκαῖον ἥν τοῦτο γενέσθαι)
which is contrary to our own experience of deliberation and action) He
then solves the difficulty as follows, τὸ μὲν οὖν εἶναι τὸ ὃν ὅταν ᾗ, καὶτὸ μὴ
ὃν μὴ εἶναι ὅταν μὴ ᾖ, α’νάγκη· οὐ μὴν οὔτε τὸ ὃν ἅπαν ἀνάγκη εἶναι, οὔτε τὸ μὴ
ὃν μὴ civennam} ἐπὶ, τῆς ἀντιφάσεως ὁ αὐτὸς λόγος· εἶναι μὲν ἢ μὴ εἶναι ἅπαν
ἀνάγκη, καὶ ἔσεσθαί γε ἢ μή· οὖ μέντοι διελόντα γε εἰπεῖν θάτερον ἀναγκαῖον (Le.
the necessity belongs to the compound judgment not to its parts taken
separately) ; λέγω δὲ οἷον ἀνάγκη μέν ἔσεσθαι ναυμαχίαν αὔριον ἢ μὴ ἔσεσθαι,
αὖ μέντοι ἔσεσθαί γε αὔριον ναυμαχίαν ἀναγκαῖον οὐδὲ μὴ γενέσθαι. In the De
Fato 21, C. says that he w'ould rather accept the teaching of Epicurus et
negare omnem enuntiationem aut veram esse aut salsam than allow that all
things happened by necessity, but he cites Carneades to prove that no such
consequence as necessity is really involved in the Disjunctive J udgment
In reality Epicurus seems to have taken much the same view ss Arist, see
Fac. 37 nisi forte volumus Epicureorum opinionem sequi, qui tale-s enun-
tinctona nec vera-³ mc falsae esee dicunt (Le. not yet corresponding to fact
but only capable of becoming so) aut, cum id pudet, alud tamen dabunt,
quod eu impatientius, veras esse ex contrariis dzjunctiones, sed quae in 1223
enunciata uomit, comm neutrum esse verum and cf. Zeller Stoica tr. p. 435,
and Ueberweg Lc., who points out the qualifications required in applying
the Disjunctive J udgment, J ohan. Siceliota, quoted by Prantl p. 360, says
that Epicurus instanoed the famous riddle ὄρνιθα καὶ οὐκ ὄρνιθα ἐπὶ ξύλου
καὶ οὗ ξύλου καθημένην λίθῳ καὶ οὔ λίθῳ βαλῶν διώλεσεν 88 contravening the
principle of contradiction.
