Hirzel (in Herm. nv p. 402) thinks that Abdera got ite character from D.'s
habit of ridiculing the follies of his neighboure3 thus we have several
fragments (Munach 16, 31, 51-56) commencing with ἄνοήμονες, e. g. ‘foolfig
though they hate life, wish to live from fear of Hadee ’, ‘ fools learn nothing
all their life long’, &c He thinks that the reproach had reference rather
to inconsistency (nutat) than stupidity.

ξ 121. dis—gratim sustulit. There seems no need for Ba'e ineer-
tion of in before dab: the dative is simply ⁴ for the gode', ‘as far ae they are
concerned’, cf. Act. ΧΠ 6 mihi quidem onmem dubitationem coderet. So
we find a dative with aufem, eripio, esc-torquw, absolvo (Ver-r. 11 2 ξ 22
Dionem szeri absolvit, sibi condemnat ‘releasee D. from his obligation to
Venus '). The reference is to the κυρία δόξα quoted on ξ 45. Aristotle
while &flowing that God took care of men (Etk. JV. Χ 8 εἴ τις ἐπιμέλεια vdit
ἀνθρωπίνων ὑπὸ θεοῦ γίνεται, ὥσπερ δοκεῖ), denied that there could be any
friendship between God and man, both on account of the inequality, and
becauseGodhasno need ofa friend, &le-MVIIIQEtlaEadvnH, M.

cum enim—naturae: ‘ while aseerting the pei-fection of the divine
nature, he at the same time (iderti, cf. ξ 30) denies to it the attribute of
kindnese, and thereby does away with that which is the essential character-
istic of a perfect nature ’. Heind. reads dicit after Walker, but that would
imply the identity of the two actione, ‘in asserting he denies '. For the
asyndeton, cf. ξ 70.

quid praestantius bonitate: a Stoic utterance, as we leam from
Pluh M 1075, αὖ γὰρ ἀθάνατον καὶ μακάριον μόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ φιλάνθρωπον
καὶ κηδεμονικὸν καὶ ὠφέλιμον προλαμβάνεσθαι καὶ νοεῖσθαι τὸν θεόν.

amati: used of the feeling, diligi of the judgment.

Ch. XLIV. censent autem: eo δὲ sometimes, where we might exmct
γὰρ, giving a sort of side explanation instead of a reason ; ‘ they hold, you
know ’. Enim is reserved to give the proof of nwlim.
