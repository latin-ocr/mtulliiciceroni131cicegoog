possess such a transcendent superiority‚ either in point of accuracy
or of age, as to make it unnecessary to weigh carefully the evidence
furnished by other MSS. I have therefore thought it my duty to
examine, as far as was in my power to do so, all evidence which
could throw a light on the condition of the text up to the end
of the 15th century. Thus, besides the critical editions of Orelli,
Heindorf and Creumr, I have had 10 constant use the Ascensian
ed. of 1511, and two MSS (U and Υ) 1008ι kindly lent to me by
S. Allen Esq. of Dublin, whose father’s name will be familiar to
students of Cicero under the Latinized form ‘ Alanus.’ I am further
indebted to J. H. Swainson, Esq., late Fellow of Triuity College,
Cambridge, for the use of his very careful collation of eight MSS.
seven belonging to the British Museum‚ and one ιο the Cambridge
University Library, as well as of the two earliest printed texts. This
collation is given in an abridged sorni at the end of the volume,
Another MS (Ο), recently purchased by the Trustees of the British
Museum, has been collated for me by a member of the staff of the
MSS department there: but in this, as in the other cases, I have
myself compared the collation with the MS, wherever special im·
portance attached to a particular reading. In like manner the
readings of four Oxford MSS given at the end of the Oxford
4to edition of 17 83 have been tested for me, e 0 u by H. P. Richards,
Esq., and ψ by J. S. Reid, Esq.¹'. Beside the 118 readings, I have
also mentioned the differences between my text and those of 80116- -
mann, Muller and Baiter, both in his earlier and later editions.

In order to show that the record preserved to us in Orelli's MSS
is at any rate not so complete as ιο dispenso either with emendations
or with a careful comparison of other MSS, Ι have given below,
lst, 8 list of passages, in which the text is supported exclusively
by what are considered the inferior MSS in opposition to all Orelli's
MSS: in many of these cases the true reading had been indepen-
dently restored by conjecture, and it is of course open to question
how far the MSS themselves are to be considered as witnessing
to a traditional reading or merely giving the scribe’s emendation3

² I may mention as an illustration of the danger of trusting to negative
evidence in the case of 118 readings, that scarcely one in ten of the inferences
which 1 had drawn ex silentio on the part of the Oxford collator of 1783 was
verisscd on examination of the uss themselves.
