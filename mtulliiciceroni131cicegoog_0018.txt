Democritus closes the series of the pre-Socratis: dogmatists, men
who devoted themselves to ·the investigation of Nature as a whole,
believing that the investigation would lead to the discovery of the
truth. Between these and socrates the great regenerator of phi-
losophy, is interposed the sceptical or Sophistic era. That the latter
was a natural and necessary stage in the development of Greek
thought will be apparent from the following consideratione :—

What we are told about Pythagoras and his disciples must have
been more or less true of all the early philosophers. The sage no

less than the poet believed himself the organ of a special inspiration,
which in the case of the former revealed to him the inner truth of

natm-03 those who were worthy to receive the revelation listened
with reverence to his teaching, and rested their faith implicitly on
their master’s authority. But when different schools sprang up,
each asserting their own doctrines with equal positiveness3 when the
increase of intercommunication spread the knowledge of these contra—
dictory systems throughout the Greek-speaking world; when philo—
sophical questions began to be popularized by poets like Euripides,
and discussed in the saloons of a Pericles or an Aspasia 3 when Zeno's
criticisms had made clear to the public, what had been an esoteric'
truth to the hearers of Parmenides and Heraclitus, that not merely
traditional beliefs‚ but even the evidence of the senses was ineapable

of standing against the reason of the philosophera—the result of all
this was a widespread scepticism either as to the existence of ob-

jective truth altogether (Protagoras) or as to the possibility of the
attainment of physica] truth by man (Socrates). If we remember
at the same time the incredibly rapid development in every depart-
ment of life which took place in Greece and especially in Athens
during the 5th century B.0.; the, sense which must have forced itself
on all the more thoughtful minds, of the incompetency of the old
beliefs to explain the problems of the new age which was dawning
upon them3 and on the other hand the growing importunes of
oratory and the immense stimulus to ambition‚ held out in a state
like Athens, to those who were of a more practical turn of mind,—
we shall not be surprised if there was much curiosity to learn the
opinions of the most advanced thinkers, and much eagerness to
acquire the argumentative power by which a Zeno could make the
worse cause appear the better. The enlightened men who came
forward to supply this demand called themselves by the name of
Sophiste, or teachers of wisdom. They were the first who made
