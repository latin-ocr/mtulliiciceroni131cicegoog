other philosophers have dissembled their views as to the immorality
of parts of the popular religion, Epicurus laid down the plain rule
' that we must conform except where impiety is commanded (p. 120);
God is friendly to the good, estranged from the bad (124) ; if Epi-
curus had been a hypocrite he would never have taken such pains in
writing on the subject of religion (p. 134)’. Hirzel p. 15 foll. calls
attention to the fact that certain points e. g. the ἰσονομία and the
quasi corpus mentioned hy Ο. are not referred to Epicurus by Diog. L.
and may probably be considered later developments of Epicurean
doctrine.

There is still the first section of Cicero to consider, which has
nothing corresponding to it in the fragments of Philodemus. It is a
'preliminary criticism of the Platonic and Stoic theories of the origin
of the world, turning chiefly on the difficulties involved in the idea
of creation at any given moment. The argument is similar to that
contained in Lucr. v. llo—234, and Plut. Pl. Phil. p. 881, but given
more fully than in either. We find no allusion to it in the following
sections of the N. D. To this is joined an argument (repeated in
the later sections) against a mundane deity, as inconsistent with the
divine attributes of rationality and blessedness. Such a preliminary
criticism comes naturally enough to prepare the way for the positive
statements of the Epicurean theology, as there was no body of
belief which could be upheld against the latter, except such as was
derived either from Plato or the Stoics.

When we try to determine the connexion between this and the
historical section which follows, there is much to suggest the con-
clusion of Krische (p. 23) and Hirzel‚ that the latter section was
inserted as an asterthought. Thus in ἓ 36 we find ut jam ad vestros
Balbe veniam, though the Stoics, whom Balbus represents, had been
already treated of in the earlier section3 similarly in regard to
Plato (5 30 compared with ἓ 18) 3 and the inconsistency is still more
manifest in g 25, if we insert alia with most editors, reading haec
quidem vestra, qualia vero alia sint ab ultimo repetam (see my notes
on these passages). It is further objected that there are no subse-
quent allusione to the historical section either by Cotta or Balbus 3
but Cotta does allude to it three times, ἐξ 63, 91, 94, and, even if he
had not done so, there would be nothing surprising in it, since Cicero,
as Schwencke remarks p. 56, is not likely to have had any Greek
treatise at hand in which the historical errors of the Epicureans were
pointed out 3 and there was no occasion for Balbus to recur to an
