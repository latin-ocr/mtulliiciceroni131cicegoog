*⁷ though this reading is supported by an the use, yet most of the Ister

editors have followed Rigalt and Davies in substituting motum for modum,
in order to suit the following motum comui junctum. In confirmation of
this emendation they quote Arist. Phys. vm 1, φησὶν Ἃ. ὁμοῦ πάντων
ὄντων καὶ ἠρεμούντων κίνησιν ἐμποιῆσαι τὸν νοῦν, but as Bouhier, Heind.
and Lengm'ck point out, the original motion by which the cognate par-

ticles were brought together was certainly not accompanied by feeling, and . '

dim-iptionem. Bucheler has shown (1312. Μιιε. n. s. 1111 600) thet the
word formerly written dam-aptio should be written dz‘ecr. whenever it
implies distribution or arrangement, ss in Sem. 59 where it is equivalent
to the διατάσσου of Xenophon.

in quo—sentiret. Epicurean object-ion: ⁶ activity and feeling, i. e.
rational life, cannot have its seat in what is infinite, noris feeling possible
. without impect'. This is again sn eppeel to the Epicurean assumption,
that rationality is only possible in a being of human form. The νοῦς of
An. is described by himself in the words ἄπειρόν ἐστιν καὶ αὐτοκρατὲς καὶ
μέμικται οὐδενὶ χρήματι, ἀλλὰ μοῦνοι· αὐτὸς· ἐφ’ ἑωυτοῦ δστιν...ἴστι γᾶρ

Simpl. in Phys. f. 336. The last sentence reminds one of the fragment of
Philodemus p. 66, where we read that ‘ mind was, and is, and will be
hereaster'‚ and that ‘it rules and governs all things and superintends their
infinite combinations'. Though it is doubtful whether An. himself ex-
preffily deified Nous, later writers were certainly justified in regarding it.
as divine (Sext. Emp. ΜαιΙι. 11 6, Cic. Ae. Lc.) as is practically done by
Vell. here. On the other hand he is said to have been banished from
Athens for impiety in asserting that the sun was a red-hot stone (Sohau-
bach Avm. fray. pp. 38-52, 139-142), since as Plutarch says (Pericles 23),
they could not endure the substitution of irrational causes and blind forces
in place of the old divinities.

motum sensui junctum· . this is the distinctive property of mens ·
(mmjfer unde oritur pn'mwn per viscera metm, Lucr. 272). Thus
Aristotle says (Anim- 1 2) that the ἔμψυχον is thought s distinguished
from ἔψυχον by two marks κινήσει καὶ τῷ αἰσθάνεσθαι.
