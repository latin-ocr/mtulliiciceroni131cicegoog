ante enim—amittere. Of. n. on ξ 17 libero judicio, and Zeller Epi·
cut-eam, tr. p. 394, where many passages are quoted in illustrat-ion of the
rigid dogmatism of the Epicurean school. Thus the last words of the
founder to his disciples were τῶν δογμάτων μεμνῆσθαι Diog. L. x 16 ; any
divergence from the dogma-s was looked upon as παρανόμημα, μᾶλλον δὲ
ἇσίβημα, καὶ κατέγνωσται τὸ καινοτομηθέν, Euseb. Praep. Eo. xlv 53 and
Philodemus (quoted by Hirzel p. 107) says that Epicuream who are guilty
of schism οὗ πάνυ μακρὰν τῆς τῶν πατραλοιῶν καταδίκης ἀφεστήκασιν. Hirzel
however has shown (pp. 98-199) that there was more of movement and
variety in the Epicurean school than has been generally recognized. Quin-
tilian 111 2 says the same of philosophers in general, haec inter ipsos qui,
velut sacramento roqati vel etiam superstitione commisi, msa-3 ducant α eus-
cepta eenoel persuasione discedere.

ξ 67. quid enim mersas: ‘ what would tempi. you to abendon the
system‘l' lit. ‘ what would you take as pay, what bribe must one offer you‘t'
Sch. quotes En„ 11 74 quid merearis ut dibus te omnia voluptatis cama
facturum? Verr. 1v 135 quid arbitramini Reqinos merere velle ut ab iis
marmorea illa Venus auferatur? cf. also Phil. 1 34 puteum alum imnwrta-
litatem mereri voluisse ut propter armorum habendorum lucaniam nietueretwr,
where see var. ππ» It is a colloquial phrase and occurs not unfrequently
in Plautus.

nihil—deseram: ‘ nothing would tempi, me to forsake happiness and
truth ’.

ista—est Veritas: for the attraction of istud sec ἕξ 77, 122, and Roby

ξ nm de vita—langueat: ‘ as to happiness I make no objection3 your
system may be productive of that inactivity which you call happiness '.
Flam otio lan-queat.- ‘ absoluiely dying of ennui ', cf. ξ 7.

sed ubi—fingentibus: ‘ can unchanging truth exist in those ever-

changing worlds, or in senseless atoms 2²

'mundis innumerabilibus: cf. Fen, 1 21 innunwrabdee mundi qui et
oriamur et intereant cotidie and my n. on ξ 53. Epicurus defines the
term in his epistle to Pythocles (Diog. L. x 88) κόσμος ἐστὶ περιοχή τις
οὐρανοῦ ἄστρα τε καὶ πάντα τὸ φαινόμενα περιέχουσα, ἀποτομὴν ἔχουσα ἀπὸ τοῦ
ἀπείρου. Worlds are infinite in number, of all shapes and sines, and perish‚
not as Democritus said from collision with other worlds, but from their
own perishable nature (Diog. 90, cf. Lucr. v 235 folL).

omnibus minimis: so 11 141 omnes minimos friyoris appui-em, 111 86
in. regnis omnia minima curant, cf. Madv, on Pin„ 111 3.

nulla moderante natura: apparently contradictory to ξ 53, where
Vell. says tho world is natura effectum .· but there natura is opposed to an

intelligent agent, here it is used rather in the Stoic sense and opposed to
the capricious movements of the atoms, cf. Schsss n. here and my n. on
