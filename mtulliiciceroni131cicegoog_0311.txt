THE BACCHAE OF EURIPIDES.

with Introduction, Critical Note3‚ and Archaeological IllustrationS,
by J. E. SANDYS, Μ.Α., Fellow and Tutor of St John's College, Carn-

bridge‚ and Public Orator.

‘⁴ Of the present editiori os the Bacche by
Mr Sandys we may safely say that never
before has a Greek play, in England at
least, had fuller justice done to its criti-
dsm, interpretation, and arehaeologieal il-
lustration, whether for the young student or
the more advanced scholar. The Cambrid e
Public Qrator may be said to have taken the
lead in issuing a complete edition of a Greek

lay, which is destined perhaps to

oubled favour now that the study o ancient
monuments has been applied to its illustra·

‘⁸ This work is in many ways creditable to
the University of Cambridge. The solid and
extensive eruditiori of Mr Cope himself bears
none the less speakin evidence to the value
of the tradition whic he continued, if it is

ever be regretted that a work so laborious
should not have received the last touches of
its author, the warmest admiration is due to
Mr Sandys, for the man1y‚ unselfish, and un-
flinchin spirit in which he has performed his
most difficult and delicate task. li· an English
