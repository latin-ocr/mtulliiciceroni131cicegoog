GREEK PHILOSOPHY. XXV

which make up the world of sense¹2 All knowledge is reminiscence.
What cannot be traced back to this intuitive consciousness in the
soul itself is not knowledge, but mere opinion. Dialectic is the
means by which the soul is enabled to recover the lost consciousness
of the Ideal. Th0 highest Ideal, which is the foundation of all
existence and all knowledge is the Ideal Good, personified as God.
He² as the Creator or Demiurgus, formed the universe by imprinting
the ideas on the formless chaotic Matter. The process of creation is
described in the Timaeus under the form of a myth, Plato holding,
like Parmenides, that it was not possible to arrive at more than
a symbolical adumbration of physical truth. The cause and ground
of creation is the goodness of God, who seeks to extend his own
blessedness as widely as possible. He begins his work by con-
structing the sous of the world out of the two elements before
him, the immutable harmonicus Ideals and changing discordant
Matter. This soul he infuses into the mass of matter, which there-
upon crystallizes into the geometrical forms of the four elements, and
assumes the shape of a perfect sphere rotating on its axis. The
Kosmos thus created is divine, imperishable and infinitely beautiful.
Further‚ each clement is to have living creatures belonging to it.
These belonging to the element of fise are the Gods, both the
heavenly bodies and those of whom tradition tells us. All these
were fashioned by the Demiurgus himself, but the creaturos be-
longing to the other clemente, including the mortal part of man,
were the work of the created gods. The immor-tal part of man,
the reason, is of like substance with the soul of the world, and was
distributed by the Demiurgus amongst the stars till the time came

for each several particle to enter the body prepared for it by the
created gods, where it combined with two other ingrediente, the

embodied Pleto’s sublime conception. The lact which underlies it was well
illustrated by the late Prot. Sedgwick, commenting on Locke’s saying that ‘⁴ the
mind previous to experience is a sheet 01 white paper” (the old rasa tabula),
“Nsked he eomes from his mother’s womb, endowed with limbs and senses
indeed, well fitted to the material world, yet powerless from want oi use: and
as for knowledge, his soul is one unveried blank3 yet has this blank been
already touched by a celestial hand, and when plunged in the colours which
surround it, it takes not its tinge from accident, but design, and comes forth
covered with a glorious pattern.’'-Discourse p. 53. The common-sense Philo·
sophy of the Scotch and the ἃ priori judgments oi Kant are other forms of the

seme doctrine.
