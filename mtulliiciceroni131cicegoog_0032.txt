ἄγου δέ μ’ ὦ Ζεῦ, καὶ σύ γ’ ἠ Hermaion,
ὅποι ποθ’ ὑμῖν εἰμὶ διατεταγμένος ·

ὡς ἕψομαι γ’ ἄοκνος· ἦν δὲ μή θέλω,

κακὸς γενομένω, οὐδὲν ἦττον ἕψομαι.

From this it follows that the szmnmwm bonum is to live according
to nature and it is through virtue or wisdom that we are enabled to
do this. One who thus lives is αὖταρκής, in need of nothing. External
good, external evil are matters of indifference3 they only provide the
field in which virtue is to exorciso itself. Pleasure is a natural
concomitant of activity, but is not a natural end: not even if we
count as pleasure that high delight which belongs to virtuous activity,
for pleasure regarded in itself has a tendency to lead man away from
the true end, viz. acting not for self, but for the whole. Man's reason
being a part oi* the reason of the universe reveals to him the divine
law. As the emotions are liable to confuse or to disob‘ey reason, it
is the part of the wiso, i. e. of the virtuous‚ man to uproot them
altogether. Wisdom is not only speculative, judging what is in
accordance with nature or the divine law, but practical, strongly
willing what is thus determined to be right. We may distinguish
different virtues in thought, but in fact no virtue can exist apart.
He who has a right judgment and right intention is perfectly
vix-tuom, he who is without right judgment and intention is per·
fectly vicious. There is no mean. The wise man is perfectly happy,
the fool perfectly miserable: all the actions of the former are wise
and good3 all the actions of the latter foolish and bad. There may
be a progress towards wisdom, but, until the actual moment of con-
versi'on, even those who are advancing (οἱ προκόπτοντες) must still be
classed among the fools. Thus we have the strange union of a highly
ideal ethice with a materialistic philosophy. But it was impossible
to maintain this uncompromising idealism in practice. The later
Stoice found themselves compelled to admit fihat apart from virtue
and vice, the absolute good and evil, there were preferences to be
made among things indifferent, from which it followed that besides
perfectly virtuous actions (κατορθώματα) there was a subordinate class
of appropriate actions (καθήκοντα). In the same way, since they were
compelled to allow that their perfectly wise man, whom they vaunted
to be equal to Zeus, had never existed, they found it necessary to
allow a positive value to προκοπή, progress towards wisdom, and to
sels-control, as contrasted with absolute apathy.

One other characteristic doctrine of the Stoics may be mentioned
