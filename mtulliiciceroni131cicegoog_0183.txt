non vidit—mundo. Epicurean polemio: if each soul is a part of the
divine soul, then (l) the separate existence of human 801118 must cause a
laceration of the universal soni, (2) when the individual soul is consciens of
pain, apartofdivinity isin pain, (3) each soulmustpartakeinthe infinite
knowledge of the universal soul, (4) it is impossible that an incorporeal
seul could be united with a material world. For obj. (1) cil ξ 24 dei mambra
ardema.- it is of course merely attaining the metaphor of carperentur.
Both this and the following obj. are based on the Epicurean assumption of
perfect happiness 88 essential· to divinity. On the Epicurean pessimism
(quod plenaque continqeret) see ξ 23 11. obj. (4) 18 inapplicable: the writers
vwho attribute to P. the derivation of the human seul from the divine
represent him 88 materialixing both under the form of fire or aether.

’ distractione: Ba. adopts Ruhnken's conjecture detractione referring
to the separation ofeach soul from the universal soul; but the ns reading
may be defended as expressing the division of the universal 80111 among a
number of human souls· oeniinue detrahitur de deo, but deus daca-ahaua· tn
am'aenoae.

infinity of the universe Arist. (Met. Α. 986 b.) distinctly tells us that while
Parmenides made the One πεπερασμένον, reg-arding it from the ideal side,
and Melissus, regarding it from the material side, made it ἔπειρον, Xeno—
phanes οὖθὲν διεσαφήνισεν ἀλλ’ εἷς τὸν ὅλον οὐρανὸν ὀποβλίψιιε τὸ ἓν εἷναί
φησι τὸν θεόν. In the Aristotelian treatise, Heliseus, however (c. 4) it is
argued that, if God is spherical <as X. affirmed) he must also be finite,
σφαιροειδῆ ὅντα ἀνάγκη πέρας ἵχειν, whence later writers attributed thie
doctrine to him, eg. Galen, Hiet. Pla. 111 24 εἶναι πάντα ἕν, καὶ τοῦτο ὑπάρ-
χειν θεὸν πεπῖερασμένον, λογικὸν, ἀμετάβλητον. On the other hand we read
(Meliss. 2) ἡδ8ἡ X. supposed the earth to extend downwards and the air

⁸ upwards to infinity which may have given rise to ἡδο representation of his

doctrine here followed by C. or this may have misen, 88 Krische thinks
(p. 91) from the confusion between ἡδο infinite in time (ἀίδιον) and the

infinite in space (ἄπειρον) οἱ Helm. 1, and Zeller 1⁴ 494. One might have
expected to find some reference here to ἡδο noble protest made by Xen.
against the debasing ideas connected with the popular religion, but ἡδο
Epicureans in their allusione to other philosophers only thought of exalting
their own master, and Xen’s ridicule of anthropomorphism would make

his writings especially distastefiil to them. The fragments of Xen. were
collected and explained by Karsten, 1830.
