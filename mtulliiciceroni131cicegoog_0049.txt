in 0., as will be seen from the following summary of Phys remarks,
‘ The Stoics in general are far more opposed to the established
·religion than we Epicureans3 if they grant the existence of a deity,
which they do not all do, they at any rate acknowledge no more than
one God‚ while they impose on the multitude with their names and
allegories. They are worse atheists‚ with their ethers and elemen ts,
than Diagoras, who confessed the existence and power of the Gods.
By asserting that God cannot be the author of evil they do away
with religione sanctiens, which we retain3 they call the Gods mortal‚
we assert their eternity. Even if ,they allowed punishment in word,
who could sear these senseless elements'l None would regard Gods
incapable of motion or of sense; or pay any heed to the moral teach-
ing of those who are in doubt whether there are Gods or what is
their nature, or who plainly deny them: men might even be encou-
raged to sin by those who speak of endless strife among the Gods.
Thus the philosophers are reducing men to the state of brutos, for
they remove the check of religion and also of public opinion, which
are the best helps for restraining injustice.' It is plain that there
is more of serious thought and of a real interest in religion and
morality here, than there is in the fii ppant sarcasms put into the
mouth of Velleius.

We go on to the other sections of Philodemus. The first, dealing
with the popular mythology, is made by C. a mere appendix to the
section we have just been considering3 and while it occupies some
60 pp. in Ph. it is condensed into a dozen lines by C. It will be seen
from my nn. on ἓξ 42, 43 that most of the points touched by C. are
fully treated by Ph„ but there is no allusion to the Magians in the
extant fragments of the latter. In the 3rd section‚ as far as we can
judge from broken phrases (see n. on ἓ 49 docet eam esse vim), Ph.
seems to have treated of the divine nature in a manner not unlike Q:
he speaks of the Gods as free from anger and favour and absolutely
perfect and blessed‚ and he is equally strong‚against superstitious
ἴωπες but he makes religion a much more practica] thing (see the
passages quoted on ἓ 44 quod beatum esset). Thus ‘piety is productive
of innocense and harmlessness (p. 95); by innocence man may imitate
the blessedness of the Gods (p. 148) 3 Epicurus honoured his parents,
loved his brothers, observed all religious duties (p. 118), and charged
his disciples to do the same in obedienee to the laws (p. 126), but
not for that reason only, but also because prayer is natural when we
think of beings surpassing in power and excellence (p. 128); while
