fidenter ut solent: et Diog. L. x 121, (Epicurus affirmed that the ‚

sago δογματιεῖν καὶ οὐκ ἀπορήσειν.) Self-oonfidenoe is the natural chamo-
teristic of the materialistic or anti-spiritualist philosopher-s, a Hobbes, a
Bentham, a Comte, who see clearly because their field of view is limited.
Those who have had a deeper feeling of the littleness of man in conti-ast
with the vastness of the universe have been fain to take refuge in a docta
iynoramia, professing with Socrates that they know nothing, or with
Plato seeking to find the best of human reasonings and use it as a rast.
for the voyage of life, εἰ μή τις· δύναιτο ἀσφαλέστερον καὶ ἀκινδυνότερον
ἐπὶ βεβαιοτέρου ὀχήματος, λόγου θείου τινός, διεκπορευθῆναι (Phaedo 85).
Compare the manner in which the latter enters upon the discussion of
this subject in the Τι’πιαεω as translated by Ο. (c. 3) siser-ee de deorum
natura ortuque mundi dassen-emes minue id quod avemus consequemur,
baad sane erit miram, concordique esee debebitis εἰ probabilia dieantur.
Aequum est enim meminisse et me qui disseram hominem ecoe et voe qui
judicetis. It is probable that in his representation of Velleius O. had
in his eye the sophists of the Platonic Dialogues, such as Thrasymachus,
and intended to exhibit him rather as the butt of the company3 but the
arrogant, bantering tone, and the misrepresentation of opponente, are
quite in accordance with what we are told elsewhere of the Epicureans : cf.
what is said of Zeno and others ξ 93, and Hirzel p. 28 foll. On C.’s own
position with regat-d to Epicureanism see Imroduetion.

ex deorum concilio: see n. on ξ 43 venerari Epicurum. It is curious
that G. was attacked for using the same phrase of himself, probably in his
poem on his Consulship, see Quintil. 11 1 24 Jovem illum a quo in oon-
edium ὠοηιπι advocatur foll.

worlds of Ep. (ξ 53) where he supposed the Gods to have their habitation,
apert from all cares and (langere (Diog. L. x 89). It is the Homeric
Olympus, rationalized by Aristotle, and adapted, or rather forced into
the ‘Epicurean scheme, cf. Arist. Cael. 11 1. The word occurs again Fiu„

Epicurus perlucidos et perflabiles et habitantes, tanquam imer duos luteos
