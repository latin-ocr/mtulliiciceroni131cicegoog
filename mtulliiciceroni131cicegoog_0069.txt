APPENDIX on nAvms' mss, - lxix

Codice suo, quem jam per decennium, opinor, apud te detines. Op·
timeum esset ei velles tibi describere, et codicem hue remittere ,· dom
enim tam boumn libowm toan diu bibliothecae suae bcwpletissimao
deesse. To this Graevius replies Nov. 1702, describendas varias
mandavi juveni, ne lonyius justo retineatur hic liber. Proximo vere
ut salvus Viro Summo reddatwr mibi erit επακ and again in De-
cember Cicero in quo nunc deam-ibendo sudat adolescens redibit ad
vos prooeim cwm hirundine. The correspondence closes with a letter
from Burmann in the following mouth, J an. 15 1703, announcing

Graevius’ death.
It would be interesting to know whether the collation made by

the adolescens was ever completed‚ and whether it is still in existence
at Utrecht or elsewhere. Th‘e volume itself must have been returned
to its owner, as it was lent by him to Davies for his lst ed. of the
Tmculans, which appeared in 1709, and seems to have been used by
the latter until his death in 1732. As Bp. Moore’s Library was
purchased by Geo. I and presented to the University of Cambridge
in 1715, the Stephanus ought ιο have found its way to the Univer-
sity Library, and to be now safely locked up in one of the cases
there, but Mr Bradshaw‚ the present learned Librarum, informs me

that he can discover no trace of it, nor is there anything to be heard
of it at Queens' College, of which Davies was President.

I turn now ιο the Codex Regius which is described as follows in
Davies' preface ιο the N.D., ms Elienses excipit Codex membrana-
ceus in Bibliotheca Reyia Londini servatus, cujus milii copiam fecit
Ricbaaedus Bentleiue. The same MS is described in the Prefaoe ιο
the De Leqibue as belonging to the Royal Library at St J ames' 3
mutibus eet, nec alima mdiaan partem libri secundi proqreditwr. Est
annorum, ut videtur, cccc. It was also used for the Academica Bk. 11
and for the De Divinatione and De Fato, but apparently not for the
Tusmdam, where Req. stands for a Paris Codex. Bentley who suo-
oeeded J ustell as “Library Keeper to His Majesty at St J ames’ '² in
Apri] 1694, wrote in May to Graevius, offering to send him vcta-iamet
lectiones a duobus vetustissimis Godd. ex Bibliotheca Βορέα Sancti
Jmobi, but it does not appear whether they were ever sent. As the
King's Library was removed in 1752 to the British Museum, these
two codices ought now to be there, but by a strange fatality these
also have disappeared. Is it possible that they were among the 200
volumes ‘destroyed or greatly injured' by the fire at Abingdon House
in 1731, on which see Monk’s Life os Bentley, 11 308.
