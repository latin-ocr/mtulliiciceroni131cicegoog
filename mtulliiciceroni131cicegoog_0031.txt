The physical theory of the Stoics is a pwntheistic mata-iulum
The only real existences are such as can act and be acted upon, and
these are bodies, for like 0011 only act on like. But these bodies are
not moved simply by mechanical laws, 00 Democritus supposed. The
whole universe is an embodied spiritual force, of which we may call
0110 part passive, one part active, but all is alike material. The
active portion is 00111, 0 fiery ether pervading the whole, but having
its principal seat in the heaven which encompasses it on every side;
the passive portion consiste mainly of the inferior elements, water
and earth. These latter proceed from the former and are periodically
reabsorbed into it in the world-conflagration. The universe itself‚
as a perfect living creature, is rightly called God, but the name
is more particularly given to the soul of the universe, who is also
known by many descriptive appellations, Rational or Artistic Fire
(πῦρ νοερόν, πῦρ τεχνικόν), All-penetrating Air, spirit, Reason, Nature,
Providenoo, Destiny, Law, N ecessity, the Ruling Principle (τὰ ἤγο·
μανικόν), 01111, with reference to his creative and ‘informing' power,
the Generative Reason (λόγος σπερματικός). The gods of the popular
religion represented different activities of the one true Deity. The
human soul is an emanation from Him. Although it outlives the
body, it will only retain its individual existence till the next con·
flagration, and that only in the case of the wize. The stars being
made of pure fire are divine.

In all this we see the influence of Heraclitus, who was much
quoted by the 810100, though the distinction of the active 01111
passive elements in the universe has been with some probability
referred back to the Aristotelian distinction between Form and
Matter. They agreed with Aristotle also in holding the unity,
finiteness 01111 sphericity of the world, but, unlike him, considered
that there was an unlimited void beyond it. That which was
peculiarly Stoical was the strong moral colouring which they gave
to their materialistic system. The all-pervading fire was at the
same time the all-seeing Providence who created and governed all
things for the best ends, 01111 makes each several existence, each
several fact, conspire together for the good of the whole. It is the
privilege of man to be able knowingly and willingly 10 001 as a
rational part of the rational whole, instead of yielding himself up
to 111-01101101 01111 selfish impulse: but however he acts, he must
perfores carry out the divine purpose, as Cleanthes says in his noble

hymn:
