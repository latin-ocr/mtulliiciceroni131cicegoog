to others. Hippias of Elis and Prodicus of Ceos were some twenty
years younger than Protagoras. 'I'he former was best known for
his scientific attainments: he is said to have given utterance to
the revolutionary sentiment of the age in the phrase, ‘Law is a
tyrant over men, forcing them to 110 many things contrary to nature?
Prodicus is famed for his moral apologue on the Choice of Hercules
narrated by Xenophon. Cicero (N. D. 1 118), following Philodemus,
reports that he considered the Gods of popular religion to be merely
deified utilities, Bacchus wine, Cems corn, 1110.

But the extreme effects of the disintegration of established beliefs
were not· seen in the teachers, but in some of their pupils who were
less dependent on public opinion, young aristocrats who fretted

disorganized state of society in order to grasp at power for them-

selves. Such was the Callicles of the Gorgias, such Critias 6611

the one side, and the establishment of objective truth on the other.
The main lines of his philosophy are given in three famous sen-
tences: (1) that of Cicero, that he brought down philosophy from
heaven to earth; (2) his own assertion that he practised m regard
to the soul the art (μαιευτική) which his mother had practised in
regard to the body, bringing to birth 6611 0063010636633 truths before

first to introduce inductive reasoning and general definitions. But
more important than any innovation in regard to method was the
immense personal influence of Socrates. His force of will, his in·
