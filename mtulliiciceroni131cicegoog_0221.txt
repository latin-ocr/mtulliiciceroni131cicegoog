were capable of producing it by their union3 otherwise they could never have
met togetherin the infinitude of space: and sinceall infinites are equal
according to Ep. (no doubt one of the points alludedto in the phrasemaqna
omaeemplatiom dignissim) it follows (1. 669 foll.) that the different kinds
of atoms are equal in number, and that the elements of production and
destruction wago an equal war (Lucr. v 392). Munro finds a further allusion
to the law of ῖσονομία in v1 5423 see his notes, and Hirzel 85-90.

eam esse naturam—respondeant: ‘ such is the constitution of the
infinite whole that all its parts are exactly balanced one against the
other'. On the repetition of words in distributive phrases see Beier Offi
1 53.

amabilem tributionem: ‘ equal distribution ', a very rare meaning
of tributio. [It is meant to be a literal translation of ὶσο-νομία. R]
See the Academic criticism in ξ 109, where aequilibritas is used to
translate ἰσονομία. O. is the only authority who formally attributes
this doctrine to Ep.; the word is used by Plut. qu. Or. 34 εἴπερ οὖν ἦ
φύσις darana τὴν ῖσονομίων ἐν πᾶσι, and the equilibrium of positive and
negative forces is often referred to in the early philosophers, as Heraclitus
and Empedocles3 cf. too Plato leeaet. 176 on the necessary existence of
an opposite ιο good, and Pseudo-Arist. De thdo c. 5, Heracl. Alleq. 444,
Orig. c. Celo. 1v 63 (quoted by Sch.) on the necessary equipoise of the four
elements, ·

quae interimant—quae conservent: this is not to be understood of
substances op persons, but, as Lucr. 11 569 more accurately expresses it,
of movements3 mc superare queunt motus itaque exitialis Ι perpetuo neque
{nmmumoepelire salutem Ι neoporro rerum qenitalie auctificique Ι motus
papante possum servare oeeata. Since on the whole the destructive and
conservative forces are equal, and since the destructive prevail here, there
must be elsewhere a region where the conservative forces prevail, and what
can this be but the inter-mundio: 3 And, since mortals and immortals

are equally balanced, and here experience shows that all is mortal, where
can we find these immortal beings but in the Gods? In 11 1105 foll.

Lucr. describes how a world gradually grows up under the shaping blows
of the atoms, and then how, when it has once attained maturity, the
destructive movements gain the upper hand, the constituent atoma fly
apert, the external blows no longer weld the mass together, but break it
down in ruin, a process of which, he says, we may already see the beginning
in our earth. It is unkind to touch the card-castle of the Epicurean
philosophy, or one might be disposed ιο ask why there might not be suffi-
cient employment for the conservative forces in the constant building up

of new worlds as the old ones perish, without finding aspecial seat for them
in the inter-»nundin ,⁰ and how these auctifici motus are to show themselves
