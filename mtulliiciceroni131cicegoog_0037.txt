enthusiasm. The Academy on the other hand was endeared to him
as being iineally descended from Plato, for whose sublime idealism
and consummate beauty of style he cherished an 'admiration little
short of idolatry, and also as being the least dogmatic of systema, and
the most helpful ιο the orator from the importance it attached ιο
the use of negative dia-lectio. But while Cicero defended the
Academic doctrine of Agnosticism in regard ιο speculative questions
of metaphysics, while he held it impossible to give any demonstrative
proof either of the immortality of the soul or of the existence of
God, he refused, both on the ground of sentiment and of policy to
extend his scepticism to practical questions of morality and religion.
He held in common with the Stoice that the universal instinct of
mankind must be regarded as testifying to a universal truth 3 and,
in common with Scaevola and the elder generation of Roman states-
men, that it was the duty of a good citizen ιο accept the tenets of the
national religion except in so far as they might be inconsistent with
the plain rules of morality. Thus the conclusion of his argument on
the nature of the Gods may be considered ιο point the way, vaguely
indeed and hesitatingly, ιο the mysticism of later times, when the

human mind wearied out with its fruitless search after truth, abjured
reason for saith, and surrendered itself blindly either to the traditions

of priests or to the inward vision of the Neo-PlatonistS.
