ν ignes, terrae, maria. The singular is more naturally used ‘of the
simple elementa, as in §193 the plural of the lands and seas which con-
stitute our globe. Perhaps the latter is employed here ιο give a certain
inflation ιο the style suited to the ironical force of the sentence. So in
ξ 100 and Leq. 1 61 it may be explained as poetical hyperbole, ‘all lands,
all seas', or are we ιο consider it only the expression of the naive view
which makes our earth the chief member in the univeme‘l Caelum stands

8181118 et luminibus. Ι think Ernesti right (against Heind.) in sup-
posing a play on words here. It suits the jocular tone of the passage and
particularly the reference ιο the aedilcs. The constellatione (cf. § 35,
Lucr. 1 2, v 691) and luminarios of heaven are compared ιο the statues
and illuminations with which the aediles adorn the public buildings of
Rome -on festal days. The custom originated according to Livy (11 46)
with the victory of the Samnites Β. ο. 307, when the buildings in the forum
were decorated with the gilded shields and other spoils; inde natum
initium fori ornandi ab aedilibus cum tenuas ducerentur. So Suetonius
tells us (Caes. 10) that Julius Caesar, when aedile, praeter conticium ac
forwm basilicaeque etiam Capitolium ornavit. We learn from Asconius ad
Verr. 1 22 that statues and ornaments were borrowed from Graece and
elsewhere for these decorations, olim cum in foro ludi populo dae-emm

spectacles were not uncommon‚ especially at the Floralia, the Saecularia,
and the Saturnalia, cf. Ov. Fasti v 361, Dio Cass. Lvm 19, Suet. Any. 31,
Stat. Silo. 1 6 85. They were much patronized by Caligula (Suet. Cal. 18),
Nero (Tac. Anu. nv 20) and Domitian (Suet. Dom. 4).
