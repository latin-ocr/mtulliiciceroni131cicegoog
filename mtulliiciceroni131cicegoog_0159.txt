opifex z a less dignified word than ‹2me by which C. (Tim. 2) translates
the Platonic δημιουργός. Ambrose (Hem. 1 1) states plainly the difference
between the Christian and Platonis ideas of creation. Plato held deum
non tanquam creatoremmateoiaeoed tanquam amfiomnadeaeenwlarfoeissel
mundum de mm thus assuming three First Principles, God, Matter,
the Ideas, instead of one. [There is the same contemptuous use of opifex

Soh. understands Rmaeo of the Locrian philosopher who is said to have in-
structed Plato in the tenete of Pythagoras (Cic. Rep. 1 16). But the particular
doctrine here referred to is not especially Pythagorean ε we find it attributed
to Socrates by Xenophon (Mem. 1 47) πάνυ ἔοικε ταῦτα σοφοῦ τινος· δημιουρ-
γοῦ καὶ φιλοζόου τεχνήματι. And there is no objection to taking de simply
as a reference to the Platonic dialogue, cf. Tusa. 111 53 Ιιί poterant omnes

1101 n. Balbus in his reply (11 73) explains that πρόνοια is not a person
but an attribute of the Deity. O. sometimes translates it by pmdmzkz,

mundum—praeditum: a doctrine common to both Plato and the
Stoice, cf. Tim. 30 B, δεῖ λέγειν τόνδε τὸν κόσμον ζῷον ἔμψυχον ἔννουν τε
τῇ ἀληθείᾳ διὰ τὴν τοῦ θεοῦ γενέσθαι πρόνοιαν.

reference is made to this passage.
ardentem. This was not Platonic, but borrowed from Heraclitus by

the Stoice, see 11 23 n.
volubilem. According to the general belief of antiquity it was the

heaven that revolved, the earth being fixed in the centre. For exceptione
to this belief cf. Ac. 11 123 and n. on celeritate ς 24.
