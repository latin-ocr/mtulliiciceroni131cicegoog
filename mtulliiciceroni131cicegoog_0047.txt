lows¹: (1) Thales, (2) Anaximander, (3) Anaximenes, (4) Anaxagorae,
(5) Alcmaeon, (6) Pythagoras, (7 ) Xenophanes, (8) Parmenides, (9) Em-
pedocles, (10) Protaqoras, (11) Democritus, (12) Diogenes of Apollo-
nia, (13) Plato, (14) Xenophon, (15) Antisthenes, (16) Speusippus,
(17) Aristotle, (18) Xenocrates, (19) Heraclides, (20) Theophrastus,
(21) Strato, (22) Zone, (23) Ariston, (24) Cleanthes, (25) Persaeus,
(26) Chrysippus, (27) Diogenes of Babylon. The first name which
we meet with in the Philodemian fragment is Pythagoras p. 66, but
there are clear allusione to Anaximenes (1) in p. 65, to Anaxagoras
(2) p. 66 (seenn. on the' corresponding pweages in the N. D.): thereis
no reference to Alcmaeon or Xenophanes, but alter Pythagoras (3)
follows Parmenides (4) in p. 67, then Democritus (5) p. 69, Heracli-
tus (6) p. 703 Diogenes of Apollonia (7) p. 703 Prodicus, alluded
to but not named, (8) p. 71, cf. p. 76 3 Xenophon (9) p. 713
Antisthenes (10) p. 723 Aristotle (11) p. 723 Theophrastus (12)
possibly alluded to in p. 73, see n. on N. D. 1 353 Persaeus (13) p.
753 Chrysippus (14) pp. 77-823 Diogenes of Babylon (15) p. 82 3
Cleanthes (16) is incidentally alluded to in p. 80, and Zeno (17) in
p. 84.

Considering the very fra g mental-y state of the Philodemian trea-
tise from p. 65 to 7 5 (i. e. till we reach Persaeus), it is remarkable
that more than half of Cicero's list should be found in it almost
in the same order⁹3 that ιιι both Aristippus should be omitted3 lastly
that both should end with Diogenes, making no mention of his suc-
cessore Antipater and Panaetius, the latter of whom exercised a far
greater influence over the Romans than any other Stoic⁸ . It appears
strange however that Heraclitus and Prodicus are not included in
Cicero’s list. Hirzel thinks this is because Philodemus identifies the
teaching of Persaeus with that of Prodicus p. 76, and the teachingnof
Heraclitus with that of Chrysippus p. 813 ιο which Schwencke objects
that Philod. gives the doctrines of Prodicus and Heraclitus by them-
selves in the first instance, and only mentions their agreement with

¹ ‘l'he names which appears only in one list are printed in italice. Diels has
facilitated the eomparison of Cicero and Philodemus by printing them in parallel,
columns (Dooeoy. pp. 531—550>.

² The order is sometimes hardly what we should expect, e.g. the Xeno-
phontio Socrates comes after Plato and before Antisthenes.

³ 'l'his is especially remarkable in a writer like Philodemus, who, as we know
from the anonymous treatise published by Compar-etti, Tui-in 1875, had touched
on these later Stoice in other writings.
