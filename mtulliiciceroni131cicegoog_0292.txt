emus nullum meritum ait. The reason for this relative clause being
prefixed to the antecedent, is probably to give it greater emphasis, as the

pietas suatim adversum dm 'rhem ‘is a great resemblanoe bo-
tween this passage and Sext. Emp. Maca. 11 123 where the existence of the
Gods is argued from the fact of εὐσέβεια and ὁσιότης, the latter being defined

as δικαιοσύνη τις πρὸς θεοὺς. καὶ μὴν εἴπερ καὶ ἦ bexano-tim· κατὰ τὴν ἐπιπλοκὴν
τῶν ἀνθρώπων πρός τε ἀλλήλους καὶ πρὸς θεοὺς εἰσῆκται, εἰ μή εἶσι θεοί,
οὐδὲ δικαιοσύνη συστήσεται. The definition is atla'ibuted to the Stoica
by Stob. Eoz. 11 124, but it occurs (amongst others) in Plato Enoekypm 12,
where τὸ εὐσεβὲς καὶ ὅσιον (they are not distinguished) is explained as that
part of justice (righteous dealing) which is concerned with τὴν τῶν θεαῖν
θεράπειαν, cf. Protay. 331. So we frequently find τὰ πρὸς τοὺς ἀνθρώπους
δίκαια contrasted with τὰ πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς ὅσια. If one may venture to say
se, O. seems to have been unfortunate in his translation of the Greek terme:
pietas is certainly nearer to εὐσέβεια than to ὁσιότης, but he makes it stand
for the latter both here and in 1 3, 11 153, cf. Or. Part. 78 justitia aya
deos reliqio,· we find a different definition in Pro Domo 107 nec est ulla
crya deos pieta-3 πίει· honesta de numine „eorum ae mente opinio, cum expeti
nihil ab iis, quod sit injustum atque inhonestum, arbitrare, which approaehes
more to Epictetus’ definition of εὐσέβεια, Ench- 31, ὀρθὰς ὑπολήψεις περὶ

θεῶν ἔχειν, ὥς ὄντων καὶ διοικούντων τὰ ὅλα καλῶς καὶ δικαίως.

homini—communitas. In the De Leqibus 1 21 fon. three grounds are
mentioned for this communita-3 (1) the benefits received from God3 (2) the
common possession of reason, incer quoe autem racio, inter eosdem ettam recta
ratio est eommunis. Quae camaleaeffioqoquoqueomuociacikomim cumdis
putandi eumue, and so we arrive at the grand Stoio description of the
world as the civicae communis deorum atque hominum § 23 ς (3) their oom-
mon kinship‚ ut, homiom deorum aynatione et qanto comantur, see Dumesnil
in loo.

sanctitas—deorum: so Sext. Emp. l. ο. ἔστι γὰρ εὐσέβεια ἐπιστήμη
θεῶν θεραπείας, a Stoio definition, as we leam from Stob. 1. e. and Diog. L.
vn 119, borrowed however from Socrates, see Xen. Mem„ Π 6 4 ὁ ἆρα τὰ περὶ
τοὺς θεοὺς νόμιμα stoebe ὄρθῶς ἂν ἡμῖν εὐσεβὴς ὥρια-μένος εἴη, and Plato
Euthyphro 14 (ὁσιότητα) ἐπιστήμην τινὰ τοῦ θύειν τε καὶ εὔχεσθαι. The
explanation of this rather inappropriate definition must be sought in the
Socratie and Stoical identification of virtue and knowledge (Zeller Soer.
