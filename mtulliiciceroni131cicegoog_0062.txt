lxii . INTRODUOTION.

against the advice of friends for whose judgement Ι have the highest
respect, and who have studied the subject far more deeply than Ι
can pretend to have done.

It appears to me that this apparently unimportant question is
not obscurely connected with the larger question whether the Classica
are still to form the staple of higher education amongst us. If their
claim to do so is to be allowed, they must show good reasons
for it, and they must at the same time leave room for other more
immediately pressing studies. Ι believe that this claim will be
allowed in so far as the study of the Classica supplies the necessary
instrument for entering into the life and thought of the ancient
world, and one of the best instruments for learning the laws which
regulate the expression of thought But the Universities will have
to see to it that this is done far more thoroughly than it has yet
been done 3 and for this purpose it will be necessary to drop some
of the impedi-menta which now occupy the time of the learner
without tending, in any corresponding degree, to discipline and
seed the mind. Yet, of late years, it seems to me that the burden
of the impedinwnta has been added to rather than reduced by the
new importance which has been given to questions of etymology and
orthography. No doubt awonderful advance has been made in these
departments, and, as special subjecte for investigation, they naturally
and rightly attract to themselves the attention of leisured scholare,
but Ι cannot think they should be made so prominent as they
have been in Oollege and University examinatione. Viewed in
relation to the main ends of a classical education, Ι hold that
spelling is simply a necessary evil, and that, for practica] purposffl,
the best spelling is that which obtrudes itself least, and least diverts
the attention of the reader from the thought of the writer. In
books therefore which are printed for ordinary reading, we should
not seek to reproduce the spelling of a particular age or of a par·
ticular author, except where, as in Chaucer, it may be needed to
show the scansion of a line, but we should endeavour to give the
normal spelling of the language after it assumed a fixed and sta-
tionary form 3 just as we do not in our common Shakespeares repro-
duce the inconsistent spelling of the early folios and quartos, though
sor the purpose os studying the history of the language we rightly
print facsimiles of these ¹. In Latin it is generally agreed that the
