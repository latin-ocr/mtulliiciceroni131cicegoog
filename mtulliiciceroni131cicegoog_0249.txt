ξ 76. hoc loco—velitis ε ‘ here you are at no loss for arguments by
which you would fain make out ², cf. quo loco ξ 13 n.

primum quod—ocem& humana: cf. ξ 46. ‘ Such is the shaping of
our minds (ie. the πρόληψις, cf. ἐξ 43, 45, 100) that in thinking of God a
human form presente itseli' to us ’.

noc esse—pulchriorem: for the loose infinitivo after non deest eopia
rationum cf. m esse aster dicamne just above; the infinitivo clause here
represents a parenthetic clause in the original direct sentence, thus kuina-
nae sumt formae, quod ita est informatam-...quod forma esse pulchewima
debet (praemiov- autem humana nulla eet). This argument is given ξ 47.

domicilium mentis: cf. ξ 48; and, for the phrase, ξ 99 οῐοπηὼἰῐάι
vitae,

ξ 77. primum quicque: ‘each in turn ', lit. ‘as it comes tothe front' 3 cf-
111 7, Ac. 11 49 with Reid's n.‚ Madv. Fin- 11 105 ; most uss have the archaic
quitquid, which is used by Lucretius in this sense, see Munro’s n. on 1 389.

arripere—vestro jure rem nullo modo probabilem. ‘you aot as if
none could disputo your right to snatch up an hypothems which ιε in no
waytobeallowed’. Arr. stronger than ewnwin§89: Lucr. useseom‘pio

quod cenam atque iqnem mortalia smnqm‘, which Munro illustratos from
Sext. Emp. Hyp. 1 90 πρὶν ἄρξασθαι τῆς κρίσεως τὰ φαινόμενα συναρπάζουσιν,
ἑαυτοῖς· τὴν κρίσιν ἐπιτρέπητε. The phrase mo jure (nearly equivalent to
suo arbitrio) means properly ‘ of his own right ’, i.e. on his own authority,
without asking leave or being liable to be called to account by another,
and then, uneontrolled‚ without hindranee, as in Florus 1 17 in mbjeocoe suo
jure detonuit, where see var. mu.

species istas—converterent. So Arist. Met. 11 8 p. 1074 b. (of the
origin of religion> τὰ δὲ λοιπὰ μυθικῶς· ἤδη προσῆκται πρὸς τὴν τειθό τὸν
πολλῶν καὶ πρὸς τὴν εἷς τοὺς· νόμους καὶ τὸ συμφέρον χρῆσιν· ἀνθρωποειδεῖς τε
γὰρ τούτους καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ζῴων ὁμοίους τισὶ λέγουσι, and Critias quoted on
ξ 118. Νο one in the present day, theist or atheist, would assign an arti-
flcial cause for so primitive and general a phenomenon. The highest
personality being involved in the idea of God, it was natural to attribute to
him the form in which personality was most clearly shown, more parti·
cularly if Μι- Hel-bert Spencer is right in supposing that ancestorworship
was the earliest form of the heathen religione, cf. δοσίοῑορμ, p. 440.
