somewhat bold for us in the nineteenth century to commence a
reform of the alphabet which Cicero used, but in the first place
we do not commcncc the reform, we merely keep the spelling
which the common sense of preceding centuries has handed down
to us3 and in the next place we know from Quintilian 1 4 5 11,
that Cicero himself felt the need of distinctive marks for the con-
sonantal and the vowel Ι, and that it was his practice to double
the I in writing such a word as Ajaoe. Though this symbol did not
pass into general use, yet it was felt by others that some sort of
distinctiva mark was needed, and a tall Ι was occasionally employed
in the imperial times to denote the consonante] sound of 1. If the
intervening generations have provided us with a more convenient
character, Ι do not see why we are to throw away this advantage,
any more than we do those of punctuation or of the discriminating
types, which were equally unknown to the Romans. Ῑ may be
allowed by the way to express my regret that Baiter, in common
with many German editors, has ceased to mark the beginning of
the sentence by a capital letter, thus making it more difficult
to glauce rapidly over a page and catch the general sense. What
was the motive for this beyond a mere love of change in trivial
details I am unable to conjecture.

If Ι may hope that my use of the letter J, as above explained,
may be conceded, as at worst a venial error, Ι fear that the par-
ticular* use of it, which I am about to confess, can only be viewed
in the light of a mortal sin by philologists of the modern school.
I refer to my retention of the oldfashioned spelling of the compounds
of ιἱαοίἶο, conjicio rejicio disjicio for conicio reicio dissici& As there
can be no doubt that the latter was the usual spelling of the
Quintilian age, how am I to defend the infringement of the rule,
which Ι have myself laid down above? My answer is that mles
must give way to principleS, and the principle of good spelling
is that it should represent correetly the etymology and the pronuncia-
tion of the word, neither of which is done by the spellings in ques-
tion. Another inconvenience arising from the omission of the J is
that the laws of prosody will thus be broken in almost all the cases
in which the compounds of jacio appear in Latin verse. In urging
these objections l do no more than repeat what was said by the
ancients themselves. Gellius has a chapter on this very subject
(N. Α. 1v 17) in which he finds fault with the omission of the
consonantal i in the compounds of jacio, as confusing versification
