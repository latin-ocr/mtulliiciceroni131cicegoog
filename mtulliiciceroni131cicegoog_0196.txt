nulla speclos divina: ‘no divine form’ i.e. no anthropomorphic aod.

qui ex omnibus—deus: ‘ whom he would have us believe to be a
single uncompounded God made up of all the fixed stass, as of dissevered
limbs’, Zeller suspects an allusion in the original to the Orphic myth of
Zagreus, which was interpreoed by later philosophers of the anima mundi
pervading the universe (Plut. M. 389 Β). Simplex is an ironical substitu-
tion for concretus, to which it is opposed in 111 343 cf. also 11 11, where it
is opposed to cum alio jwwca atque cmwxa. The phrase mundi menubm
occurs again ξ 100.

Heraclides ι a native of Heraclea in Pontus, pupil of Plato and Speu-
sippus and afterwards of Aristotle (Krische 324—336). In the letters to
Atticus there are many allusione to the Dialogues of Her. which were
distinguished from those of Aristotle by the fact that in the former (as in
the N. D.) the author was made a κωφὸν πρόσωπον, while in the latter he
was the principal interlocutor (as in the Tusculans). O. speaks of him with
respect as vir doctus in primis (Tmo. v. 8), and quotes from him Diu. 1 46
and 130. The views here ascribed to him are common ιο the Platonis
school. We are further told that he held with Ecphantus‚ the Pythagoream,
that all material objects were compounded of atoms, and that the apparent
movement of the heavens was caused by the rotation of the earth.

puerilibus fabulis : Plutarch (Camal. c. 22) describes Her. as μυθώδη
καὶ πλασματίαν, and the names of the treatises preserved by Diog. L. v
6, 87 are suggestive of a predilection for the marvellous. Like Empedocles,
he is said to have been ambitious of being worshipped as a god after his
death, Diog. L. v 90. “

sensu—vult: a criticism interposed3 ‘neither pure mind, nor gross
matter, such as the stars are composed of, is separately capable of feeling:
and to suppose that the moon and planete with their changing phasee are
divine, is to deny the immutability of the divine nature ', cf. Plato Jeep. 11

investigations upon particular points without diverging from his general
principles. Ο. charges him with assigning too much wei ght to fortune as
an element of happiness, Ae. 1 34 and elsewhere. Gomperz thinks that
the words ἐγκωμίῳ τῶν θεῶν, found in a fragment of Philodemus p. 73, refer
ιο a treatise of Theoph.'s mentioned by Diog. L. v 47.
