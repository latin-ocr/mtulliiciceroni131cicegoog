Ep. with other philosophare, including therefore his atomic doctrine so far
as it was the same with that of Dem. 3 cf. Fin. 1 18 sed Ιιοο commune vitium
(the general atomio doctrine), alae propriae Epicuri minae (the declinatio).

Lorenz’s n. Ussing on Asin. 655, and my Gr. ξ 1885. R]

ξ 68. sint· sane—ants quam nati. For the ellipse of the verb with
aeterni, nulli dei, and especially in the subordinate clauses quod ex atomis,
εἰ natum, see Draeg. ξ 116, (who compares ut cu Velleius and quot hominum
linquae ξ 84) and Roby ξ 1443, who cites ξ 110 εἰπε virtute certe nullo modo
foll.

paulo ante-disputabas: see ξ 20. To avoid this palpable incon-
sistency‚ some Epicureans appear to have introduced a third principle,
besides atoms and void, in the ὁμοιότητες, otherwise called ὁμοιομέρειαι or
στοιχεῖα, Plut. Plan. Phil. p. 882 A, Stob. Ed. p. 663 but if we arrived at a
right conclusion in our discussion of ξ 49, this ard principle consiste only
of a subordinate class of atoms composing the divine images which are
always streaming in upon the soul. It might be argued that these have
nothing concreti about them, but merely produce an impression of a oon-
tinuous form by their oeaseless repetition 3 that they have never ooalesoed
into an actual whole, and are therefore in danger of no dissolution. It is
doubtful how far such a defenoe could apply to the images; in any case it
is not applicable to the ordinary Epicurean Gods of the immnundia. The
considerations which seem to have been urged for the immortality of the
latter by the disciples of this school are (l) the equilibrium described in
ἐξ 50, 109, (2) the preservative infiuence of goodness alluded to in Plut.
Des. orac. p. 420, where the Epicurean argues against the demons of
Empedocles on the ground ὥς οὔ δυνατόν ε’στι φαύλους καὶ ἁμαρτητικοὺς
ὄντας μακαρίους καὶ μακραίωνας εἶναι, πολλὴν τυφλότητα τῆς κακίας ἐχούσης
καὶ τὸ περιπτωτικὸν τοῖς ἀναιρετικοῖς (⁶ susceptibiljty to destructive influ-
ences ²). To which it is replied that goodness has nothing to do with the
duration of the bodily organism‚ ὅθεν οὔκ εὖ τῷ θεῷ τὴν ἇῖδιότητα ποιοῦσιν
ε’κ φυλακῆς καὶ διακρούσεως τῶν ἀναιρετικῶν.

quod cum efficere vultis: ‘ for when you would prove this ’ (that the
divinity is possaesed of such attributes).

in dumeta correpffls: ‘ you hide yourself in the thickets ⁹. Of. Ac. 11
112 cum cic enim campus in quo excultare possit oratio, cur cam cavatae
in angustias ct in Scoioomm dumta compellimus ἒ So often spinae and
spinosus with a slightly different force, of the perplexing arguments of the
Stoice.

ita: explained by the following infinitiva] clause, as in Fac. 24 ica
dicimus, velle aliquid sine cau-sa, Tusc. 1 71 ita dicebat, duas ease vias, 111 41
ita—laetitiam esse, see Madv. Ρίπ. 11 13, 17, 111 53, v 77; and compare the
use of the epexegetic clause after a demonstrative or relative, Draeg. ξ 484.
