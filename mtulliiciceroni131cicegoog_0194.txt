replicatione. identified with convenio by Soh. but Krische is, Ι think,
again right m regarding it as a translation of the term ἅνείλιξις used of the

retrograde movement of the planete· . see Met. 111 8 where Aristotle explains
the apparent irregularity in the planetary movements by assigning to them
distinct ‘spheres' for the forward and retrograde movementa the latter
being called σφαῖραι ἀνελίττουσαι ‘the reversing spheres’ (Lewis Aaronom
os tlw Anciem p. 163 foll). The same word is used by Plato of the
counter·rotation of the Kosmos in the Politia-us 270 D. ξυνεπόμενα τῇ τοῦ

course it is an absurd blunder in Ο. or his authority to make the motion of
the entire universe depend upon this partia] subordinate movement, but we
have seen too much of the critic to be surprised at any blundel& and the
word replicatio does not seem to admit of any other interpretation3 it
means ‘folding back '‚ ‘rolling back’, ‘inverse rotatory movement’. Freund
(Andrews)‚ it is true, translates ‘winding up‚' which to us, familiar with
watches, might be suggestive of the action of the First-mover‚ but could
hardly be so to the ancients: moreover a periodical winding up is not con-
sistent with the constant unchanging attraction ascribed to the First-
mover by Aristotle. The addition of quaedam is perhaps a sign that Ο.
had no very clear idea of what he was talking about.

also 11 41, 64, 91, 92. The proof of its existence is given Arist. Cael. 1 2
(cf. N. D. 11 44) where it is argued that ‘as it is the nature of earth to
move towards the centre and of fire to move to the circumference, so there
must be a body which has by nature a circular movement, and that this
body must be θειοτέρα καὶ προτέρα than the others because its motion is
more perfect. To this eternal eelestial substance the ancients gave the
name αἰθὴρ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀεὶ θεῖν, but Anaxagoras wrongly identified it with fire
and derived it from εὔθυν’. (C's translation ardor shows that he followed
Anax.) The divinity of Aether is proclaimed by Euripides in the verses
quoted N. D. 11 65. Elsewhere O. speaks of it as a quintum ,qenus e quo

essent astra meaque Ac. 1 26 and Tusa. 1 65 sin est quinta quasdam
natura„ ab Aristode inducta pn‘mum, haec ec deorum est et animorum.- but
Aristotle (Gen Anim. 11 3), while he allows that in the generation of
soul there enters in an element akin to that of the stare, finer and more
divine than the other four, adds λείπεται τὸν νοῦν μόνον θύραθεν ἐπεισιέναι
καὶ θεῖον εἶναι μόνον· οὐθὲν γὰρ αὐτοῦ τῇ ἐνεργείᾳ κοινωνεῖ σωματικὴ ἐνέργεια.
If we take mimda-3 above to represent οὐρανός, we may understand ardor
omli here to represent some such original as ὅ τε αἰθὴρ καὶ τὰ ἅνω cuipare,
of which Arist. says ΕιΙι. vx ⁷ that ‘there are many things of a divinar
