“Is we could conceive anything similar
to a protective system in the intellectual de·
partmcnt‚ we might perhaps look soi-ward to
a time when our historiatis would mise the
cry os protection for native industry. of
the unquestionably greatest German men os
modern history—1 speak os Frederick the
Great, Goethe and Stein-the first two found
long since in Carlyle and Lewes biographer-s
who have undoubtedly driven their German
competitors out os the field. And now in the

ear inst past Professor Seeley of Cambridge

tion with erman works and disowns the

resumption os teaching us Germans our own
history, yet casis into the shade by its bril-
liant superiority all that we have ourselves
hitherto written about Stein.... ln five lon
chapters Seeley expounds the legislatiige ang
administrative resorms, the emancipanon of
the person and the soil, the be innings os
free administration and free tra e, in short
the foundation os modern prussia, with more
exhaustive thoroughness. with more pene-
trating insight‚ than any one had done be-
s ore. ”-Deutscke R undscha u.

“Dr Busch’s volume has made ople
think and talk even more than usual of rince
Bismarck. and Professor Seeley's very learned
work on Stein will turn attention toan earlier
and an almost equally eminent German states·
man. ...... It is soothing ιο the mecm!
sels-respect to find a few Englishmen, such
as the late Mt Lewes and Professor Seeley,

‘¹ In a notice of this kind scant 'ustiee can
be done to a work like the one ore us: no
short rasum! can give even the most meagre
notion os the contents os these volumes, which
contain no page that is superfluous, and
none that is unmteresting ..... To under·
stand the Germany of to-day one must study
the Germany of many yesterdays, and now
that study has been made easy by this work,
to which no one can hesitate to assign a ve
high place among those recent histories whi
have aimed at original research.''—Atlee·

“The book before us fills an important

p in English—my, European—historical
iteratum, and bridges over the histo of
Prussin from the time os F rederick the ‘eat
to the days os Kaiser wilhelm. It thus gives
the reader- standing ground whence he may
regat-d contemporary events nn Germany tn
