quoted on ξ 253 it is defined by Diog. 1.. x 33 as ‘a general oonoeption
retained in the mind’, ‘ the memory of what has been often peroeived ’ς ‘ on
uttering the word man, the type at once rises up κατὰ πρόληψιν (i.e. prior
to logical analysis) in aooordanoe with our previous sensatione '. Henoe

ponet), of. Clem. Al. strom. 11 157. Chrysippus appears'to 'have borrowed
the word from Ep. (see ξ 54), defining it as ἔννοια φυσικὴ τῶν καθόλου
Diog. Ia. vn 54. In an interesting chapter of Epictetus (Diu. 1 22) we read
that προλήψεις, general principles, are common to all men, and consistent
with each other: differenees arise when we attempt to apply them, e.g. all
allow that τὸ ὅσιον must be preferred to all things, but it is a question
between Jews and Romans whether it is ὅσιον to eat swine’s flesh. Educa-
tion consiste in learning to apply rtis· φυσικὸς προλήψεις· ταῖς· ἐπὶ μέρους
οὐσίαις καταλλήλως η] φύσει. Prolepsis then, whether as understood by the
Epicureans (the permanent image), or with a more ideal colom-ing by the
Stoice, corresponds to the Idea of Plato, the Form of Aristotle, the Innate
Idea of later times: by some of the Fathers (e. g. Theod. Gr. Aff. p. 16, 9·

Clem. Ζ. ο.) it was identified with Faith. Besides the terms informatio,
praenotio and oentim'patzb, C. uses for it notio and notitia, which are properly
equivalents of the more general ἔννοια, cf. Ac. 11 30 notitiae ror-um quas
