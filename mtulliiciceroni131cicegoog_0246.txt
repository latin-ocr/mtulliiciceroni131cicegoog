monly discussed in connexion with the past participle. Madvig (Opem 11 ·

solutely‚ and the notions of attainment‚ continuance, completiom &c are
only developed from the context, cf. my Gr. ἐξ 1451 and 1454, 2. We may
compare the use of ἐβασίλευσα ‘ I became king'3 I doubt however whether
it would be possible to find Marcus oon-sul fuit similarly used. R]

crime. Some explained Ep.'s depreciation of education by his dislike for
Naus. πολλοὺς γὰρ τῶν νέων συνεῖχε, καὶ τῶν μαθημάτων σπουδαίως ἐπεμε-

called a disciple of Pyrrho, who was however himself reckoned among the

si—non audisset, quid audierat: ‘ supposing he had. not heard these
lecturos, what other teaching had he received' (to make him so well ac-
quainted with the doctrines of Dem. )2 The connexion of thought is very
much broken. Heind. following Davies proposed to improve this by reading
mim aster quid. Hermippus, ap. Diog. x 2, says that his philosophica-l
interest was aroused‚ not· by hearing the lectures of Naus. (haec Dema-raia),
but by reading the actual books of Dem. περιωχόπα τοῖς Am*- βιβλία, ἐπὶ
