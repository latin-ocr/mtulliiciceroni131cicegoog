precedingmens imnot, as HirmLp.94,with a distinct reference ιο
the universe considered apart from mind, though when the unintelligible
mem infhu’ta had been changed into the absh-act ὑψῖηἰειιηι, it could not
fail ιο suggest to an Epicurean the thought of the infinite void 88 its only
legitimate interpretation. To Anaxagoras the infinity of mind meant its
unlimited wisdom and power: here it is understood of a mind not bounded
in space or inclosed ιιι body, but· the Epicuream recognized no immaterial
existence ex‘cept τὸ. κενόν, 'which can neither affect nor be affected, but
merely makes movement possible ιο bodiea ὅσθ’ oz λέγοντες cie-dmm

The meaning then would be‘ a feeling with which it would feel without

None of these explanations seem ιο me satisfactory: Sch. and Ku. give a
very harsh construction, and the latter’s quo (sc. mnu) pulsa makes unm
the cause, not the result of impact. Hirz. agrees with Sch. in retaining
the awkward construction quo (mm) sentiret, and his explanation seems ιο
make the Epicureans attribute feeling to inanimato nature, 8 conception as
abhorrent to them as that of a soul of the universe. Heind. gives a good
sense, ‘if there were an all-pervading mind then every thing would be
sensitive ', but 'if that were what O. meant, he would hardly have explessed
it so obscurely. Ι think a clause is wanted ιο balance in effato, and
