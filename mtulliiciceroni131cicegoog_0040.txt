ξ 3. DRAMATIS PERSONAE.

The Dialogus is represented as taking place on occasion of the
Fet-iae Latinae at the house of O. Aurelius Cotta. The year of its
supposed occurrence has to be determined from the following data
supplied by the Dialogue. Cotta and Cicero are both residing at
home; the former is Pontifex but not consul, the latter, in spite of
his youth, is treated as an authority in philosophical questions, and
allusion is made to his Athenian experience, which is however as-

signed to Cotta. The facts of Cotta’s life may be briefly summed
up. He was born 124 Β.ο. and like his brothers Marcus and Lucius

(who so warmly espoused the cause of O. against Catih'ne and
Clodius) took an active part in the politics of his time. He be-
longed ‘to that wise and far-seeing party in the Senate, which aimed
at checking the corrupt and oppressive rule of the jury-courts of
equites, and at breaking the power of the city rabble by giving the
franchise to the Italian yeomen' (Wilkins De Oratore p. 5). After
the murder of their leader Drusus in 91 Rc. (N. D. 111 80), Cotta
with many others οἱ the party was driven into exile under the law
of Q. Varius (N. D. 111 81), by which all who had encouraged the
insurrection οἱ the Italian allies were declared guilty of treason. He
remained in exile throughout the Social War, and only returned
home when order had been restored by Sulla in 82 Rc· Shortly
afterwards 116 became a member of the college of pontifices and in the
year 75 Rc. was elected consul. During his year οἱ “ office he re—
stored to the tribunes some of the privileges which Sulla had taken
from them. On ceasing to be consul he was appointed to the pro-
vince of Gallia, where he gained some unimportant successes for
which a triumph was decreed to him, but he died of the effects of an
old wound before he was able to enjoy it. He appears in company
with P. Sulpicius Rufus as one of the younger interlocutors in the
De Orator& and his quiet persuasive style οἱ reasoning is contrasted
with the passionate energy of the latter in the Brutus g 201 foll.
In the 3rd book of the De Oratore Cotta is said to have devoted
himself to the study of the Academic system of philosophy as a part
of the training of an orator, in consequence of a speech of Crassus
there recorded, see 5 145 nmquam conquiescam ante quam illomm
