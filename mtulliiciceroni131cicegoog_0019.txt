a profession of the higher education‚ and some of them amassed con·
siderable fortunes by their lectures on rhetoric, the art os speaking,
which was also made ιο include instruction in regard ιο political
and soeial life. The speculative interest of the older philosophers
was in them changed into a predominantly practieal interest, lst, as
ιο how to acquire wealth and notoriety for themselves, and 2ndly,
as a means ιο this, ιο attract by omniscient protensions, by brilliant
declamation and startling paradox, elever and ambitione young
men of the richer classe-⁸:15 and then ιο secure their continued
discipleship by careful training with a view ιο the attainment of
political power.

Protagoras cf Abdera (13.0. 490-415) and Gorgias of Leontini' m
Sicily (no. 480-37 5) are the earliest of the so—called Sophists.
Protagoras taught in Sicily and at Athens, from which latter place
he was banished on a charge of impiety in consequence of his treatise
on Theology referred to by Cicero, N. D. 1 29 ὅτ. 63. His treatise
on Truth began with the famous sentence, ‘Man is the measure of
all things ς’ meaning that truth is relative, not absolute, that what
each man holds ιο be true, that is true ιο him3 and similarly in
regard to conduct, that it is impossible to pronounee universally
that one kind of conduct is right, another wrong: right and wrong
depeud >upon opinion3 what is generally thought right is right
genera1153 what each thinks right is right for him, just as each
man’s sensaticns are true for him, though perhaps not for another 3
there is therefore no more reason for one general assertion than
for another, perhaps an opposite assertion. It is plain that this
was a sort cf conciliation theory naturally springing from the
fact of the opposition of philosophical schools: ‘ each of you are
equally right relatively, equally wrong absolutely; 'there is no need ‘
for quarrel! Protagoras also wrote on Grammar and Philology.
' Gorgias is said ιο have first come ιο Athens in nc, 427, and
afterwards to have travelled about giving lectures from town to town.
He devoted himself mainly ιο the cultivation of rhetoric, but also
wrote a treatise περὶ φύσεως, in which he maintained lst ‘that nothing
exists' (i. e. doubtless ‘in the absolute Eleatic sense '); 2nd that if
anything did exist, still it could not be known 5 3rd that even if
it could be known, ‚the knowledge of it could not be communicated

⁸ The general features οἱ the Sophistic period are photographed in the
Clouds of Aristophanes, and in Thucydides' chapters on the Plagae of Athens
and the Corcyrean revolution, and his speeehes generally.
