quam—caperent· . Subj. after Indefinite Relative.

velut ε cf. ξ 2 n. ’

ibes: cf. J uv. xv 3 saturam mpemibm ibin with Mayor’s n. and the
passage from Herod. quoted in my n. on ξ 82. In the notes to Rawlinson’s
Herod (VoL 11 p. 125) it is stated that the Turks still consider it a sin to
kin an ibis, and that Cuvier found the skin of a snake in the stomach of a
mummied ibis. Plut. 1. c. mentions another reason for gratitudo to the ibis,

to which Ο. also alludes 11 126.

⁴ vim serpentium: see ξ 54 n.

cum sint: ‘ being tall birds ’, δια, explains how they were able to kin
the snakes, Roby ξ 1728.

cum—interficiunt. The Pres. and Perf. Ind. are used with cum to
express ‘ identity of action' (Roby ξ 1729). In killing the snakes they are
averting the plagae.
« volucres angues: Herodotus (1. c. and 111 107 foll.) tells wonderful

stories about the winged snakes, which guard the frankincense of Arabia
and invade Egypt every spring, but are met and killed by the ibises. Sir
G. Wilkinson (in Rawlinson, p. 124).discusses what amount of truth there
may be in his account. ’

ex vastitate—invectas: ‘ brought from the Libyan desert by the
south-west wind ’ (or more strictly W. S. W. blowing from Carthago to Sicily).
This is in disagreement with Herod. and others, who represent them as
coming from the east3 Aelian H. A. 11 38 makes the black ibis guard the
eoeterm and the white ibis the southern, frontier. On the use of the abstract
vastitas for concrete, see Draeg. ξ 8.

possum: seen. on lonqumest ξ 19.

ichneumonum: the ‘ mangouste ’ or ‘herpestes ', see Art. in Enq.
Cyel. under the latter heading 3 and Rawlinson’s Herod. 11 67 n. Its
utilitas was to destroy the egge of the crocodile, which led to frequent
quari-ele between the people of Heracleopolis, the principa] seat of the
ichneumon· worship, and Crocodilopolis where the utilitas of the crocodile
was similarly honoured. Extraordinary tales are told about it, as that it
covers itself with a cuirass of mud before attacking the asp (Arist. H. Δ.
tx 6), and that it enters the mouth of the sleeping crocodile and devours
its beart and entrails (StrabO, xvn 39).

crocodilorum: see Herod. 11 68 foll. with Rawlinson's nn. Diodorus
tells us that the reply made to the question why creaturas so injur-ious to
men were worshipped, was that they formed a rampart to the country, and
prevented invaders from crossing the Nile; another answer was that a
crocodile had rendered a service to one of their ancient kings 3 Plut. on the
other hand explains their worship as symbolical ; the crocodile is μίμημα
θεοῦ ss being ὄγλωσσοσ and therefore silent, and as watching his prey,
