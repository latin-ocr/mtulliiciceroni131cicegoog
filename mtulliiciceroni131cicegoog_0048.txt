the Stoice in a later page, and that Cicero wrote in too great a hun-y
either to foresee this, or to correct what he had already written.
Perhaps this is going too far. It is plain that Cicero felt the neces-
sity for compressing very much the historical review, and a simple
means of doing this was to omit repetitions. He was also about to
speak of Prodicus in Cotta's reply (N. D. 1 118), and he alludes to
Heraclitus as the forerunner of the Stoice in 111 35, stating that, as
he chose to be unintelligible, it was useless to discuss his opinions.

So far there appears to be no improbability in Cicero's having
borrowed directly from Philodemus, but it becomes more difficult to
suppose this, when we compare the two writings more minutely.
Thus, while both criticize Anaximenes, Ph. has nothing in common
with 0., but merely speaks of air as without sensation 3 while there
is a fair agreement as to the doctrines of Anaxagoras, there is no
criticism in Ph.3 on Pythagoras and Democritus Ph. is too frag·
mentary to allow of comparison3 on Parmenides there is hardly any
agreement 3 on Diogenes they agree to a certain extent, but Ph. is
much fuller 3 on Xenophon Ph. quotes correctly, as far as the fiag-
ment is legible, but gives no criticism, while O. is wrong throughout 3
on Antisthenes they agree, but Ph. has no criticism 3 on Aristotle
there is nothing legible in Ph. beyond the actual reference 3 on Theo·
phi-astus Ph. has merely a reference to a treatise not mentioned by
O. 3 on Persaeus there is substantial agreement, but Ph. is much
fuller, he does not however give anything of the criticism we find in
0.; between Theophrastus and Persaeus O. has some 32 lines on
Strato, Zen0‚ and Cleanthes, to which there was probably something
corresponding in pp. 73-75 of Ph., where we can trace broken
allusions to the universal reason and the power that holds all things
together, but the names are lost 3 while there is general agreement
on Chrysippus (see my n. on N. D. 1 39), Ph. is much fuller, except
where O. dilates on the Stoic idea of the Divine Law 3 so on Diogenes

of Babylon.

This slight sketch will show that, if Ο. has borrowed from Ph. he
has used him with the utmost freedom, omitting without scruple‚
and, if we may weigh the evidence of the fragments according to the
ordinary law of chauces, one would say, adding not unfrequently
from other sources. It is true that the absence of criticism after
each name in Philodemus, may be explained by the fact that he
reserves it all for the end (pp. 84—89). But then when we examine
this later criticism, we find nothing in common between it and that
