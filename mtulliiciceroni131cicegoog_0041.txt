his uncle Rutilius alluded to in N . D. 111 80.

the Dialogus must be laid between 82 and 75 Β,ο.; and as Cicero
was studying at Athens in 79 and 78 and did not return to Rome

Βοῗίῐΐί is known of Ο. Velleius, the spokesman of the Epicuream,

beyond the fact that he was born at Lanuvium (N. D. 1 82), was a
friend of the orator Crassus (see note on 1 58) and held the office of
Tribune in the year 90 nc. He is called mdis dicendi (Or. 111 78),
and is described as holding the first place among the Romans of his
sect (N.D. 1 15). In the De Finibus L. Manlius Torquatus is the
Epicurean disputant.

Of Q. Lucilius Balbus, the spokesman of the Stoics, we know
even less. He was an interlocutor in the lost dialogus entitled
Hortensius and is praised as not inferior to the most distinguished
Stoics of Greeoe. In the De Finibus the Stoice are represented

one years his senior, dedicated to him four of his treatises besides the
Natura Deorum, viz. the Orator, Pwadoxa, De Finibus and Tus-
culanae Disputationes, and has also introduced him as an interlocuto:-
in the dialogus de claris oraton-ihm which is called aster him. It
appears from the De Finibus that Brutus had previously addressed a
