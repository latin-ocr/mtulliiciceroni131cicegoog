language attained its highest formal development in the period
which may be named after Quintilian, between Nero and Hadrian,
according to Brambach (II ulfibilchlein f. Lat. Rechcsckreibvmq, p. vn),
between the death of Augustus and that of Trajan, according
to L. Meyer (Orthoyraphiao Latinae Summam-ima p. 5). The latter
lays down the following mles for our modern spelling of Latin:

ne inaequalitate scribmdi aut oculi offendamu- leyentium aut in
errorem inducantur animi, scriptura nostra reddi oportet ad certae
usum ac morem anatis, et quidem qius, qua ipsa linqua scriptoram
pariter inqeniis et studiis qrammticomom ad summam esc adducta
perfectionem; and in p. 6, praeterea ut ὑπ semem, ita in scriptura
tamqnam scopulum nos fuyere oportet quaevis inusitata.

Adopting these rules, it will follow first, that we need not
trouble ourselves to frame a conjectural text, such as Cicero might
have written, hut should use the undoubted spelling of the latter
half of the first century Aa). ; and secondly, that where this spelling
itself was variable, as in the u ori of the superlative terminations‚ '
and the i or e of the accusative plural of i-nouns, we should select
one mode and adhere steadily to that. In making the selection
I should myself wish to apply to our own case the principle
suggested by Meyer's second rule, that, of two allowable spellings,
that should be preferred which is usitatius, least of a novelty to
ordinary English readers.

Turning now to Muller’s text Ῑ find there several examples of
inconsistent, and some of unusual and, as Ι believe, incorrect spelling.
This is the more to be wondered at, because m his excellent review
of Baiter and Halm's ed. in the Jahrb. f. Ol. Philol. for 1864,

vol. 89, p. 261 foll. he condemns a similar inconsistency in them.

The following are the points in which the spelling in my edition
will be found to differ from that in Muller’s:

(1) Ι have always given the superlative termination in Arnus,-
Mtlller at times has the form in mmm. Thus we find facillume
5 9, but facillimum 5 61; turpissume 5 29, but tuopissinw 5 933
simillunms 5 49, hut simillimus 5 98 3 praestantissuma-⁴3 5 47, hut
praestantissimus 5 96 3 also levissumm 5 13, vafemmzw 5 39.

’ attempt to expel the old German forms ⁸ genitiv’, ‘ Virgil’: αὖρα doch nicht
deutscher Pedantismus einen Schatten auf deutsche Wissemchaft mersen, der
ymen dicae selbst den Spoct des wei tern Kreises der Gebildeten heran-&sordem musa!
