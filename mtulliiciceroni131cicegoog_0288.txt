conservative forces. By all means, but let the conservative forces be
exerted on what is actually in existence. 1 don't perceive that your Gods
do exist.³ So Davies, Madv. Sch. Opino. 1v p. 3433 others take ea as
subject of conservent (‘ let the conservative forces be such as really exist
themselves ⁷) implying that the Epicuream identified these forces with their
Gods3 whereas the Epicurean Gods were confessedly free from the toils of
superintending the universe. Still this is not conclusive, as the disputante
in O.’s dialogue are quite capable of forgetting or passing over any point
which might be inconvenient. 'Phe reference is to the words of Vell. ξ 50
εἰ quae interimam innumrabdia sint, ctiam ea quae conservem iaefim‘ta am
debere.

ξ 110. omnis tamen—ofitur t ‘however (to leave the Gods and return
to the question asked in ξ 107), how do you explain the origin of your
object-pictures generally out of the atoms ’ἐ ’ effigies oritur is a loose expres-
sion for qffiqt'atm (or affictio) fic.

Ch. 111. de beato. Cic. prefers to use the neut adj. instead of his
invention of§95‚ so we find qamv45 ex bonis, quae sola hom-sta mu,
effic-zeuxim eet beatwn, Pin. v 85 (virtutem) in qua sit aptum etiam beatam.

sine virtute— vita ε for the omission of the verb in these short clauses
see § 68 n. That virtue is essential to happiness is asserted-by Vell. ξ 48,
and by Ep. himself in the 4th κυρία δόξα, Diog. L. x 140, οὐκ ἔστιν ἡδέως· ζῆν
ἄνευ τοῦ φρονίμως καὶ καλός καὶ δικαίως. The Academie disputant in 111 ξ 38
endeavours to prove that we cannot ascribe to God any virtue knownto us.

actuosa: but elsewhere O. recognizes the Aristotelian division of the
moral and intellectual virtues (Para Or. ξ 76) est iqitur vis virtum duplex:
aut enim scientia ematur virtus, aut actione. Nam quae prudentia...afflel-
latur, haee scae'entiapollet una: quae vero moderandis meptdztatibmnqen-
disque animi motibus laudatur, ejus est memus in agendo, and it is the
former virtue only which belongs to divinity, according to Aristotle, τῷ δὴ
(oiim-c τοῦ πρᾶττειν ἀφαιρουμένου, ἔτι δὲ μᾶλλον τοῦ ποιεῖν, τί λείπεται πλὴν
θεωρία; ὥστε ἠ τοῦ θεοῦ ἐνέργεια, μακαριότητι διαφέρουσα, θεωρητικὴ ἂν εἴη,
Ε. N. x 8.

et deus: Mr Roby proposes to read at (which might easily lose its
vowel atter actuosa, and change into et) as it introduces a minor premiss in
a quasi-syllogistic argument. But where one syllogism is subordinated to
another (as in this passage virtus autem—&itur represents the minor
premiss in the syllogism of which sine virtute nullo modo is the major, and
ne beatus quidem the conclusion) it is not uncommon to omit the signs of
opposition between the propositione of the subordinate syllogism ε thus,
A, none are happy without virtue, · B, but virtue is active and your God
inactive, therefore not virtuous; O, therefore your ‘god is not happy.

ne beatus quidem. ‘not happy either’ (wanting in happiness as well
asinvirtue), ef. §72n.‚and§ 113
