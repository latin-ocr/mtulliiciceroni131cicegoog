Thales& The statement here made as to the two principles assumed
by Τ. is opposed to all the more ancient authorities Thus Aristotle
(Hetaph. Α. 3) makes him the leader of those who started from one
material principle, and conti-asts Anaxagoras with all his predecessor-s
as having first felt the need of a separate intelligent principle. It is true
that by water T. understood something more than mere lifeless matter
moved by mechanical causes, like the atoms of Democritus, Water was
8 living substance endued with a θεία δύναμις κινητική (Stob. Ecl. 1 56)

whence Aristotle says (de An. 1 5 17) καὶ lu τᾷ ὅλῳ τινὰ· ψυχὴν μεμῖχθαί ·

φασιν, ὅθεν ἴσως καὶ Θαλῆς· ᾠήθη πάντα πλήρη θεῶν εἶναι, to which O. alludes
leq. 11 26 ς but the system was a pure ‘hylozoism'. It was therefore by a
mere misunderstanding that later compilers such as Stobaeus, l. c. and
Plutarch Plac. Phil. 1 7 p. 881 a, attributed to T., who left no writings be-
hind him, (Diog. L. 1 23) the statement that God was the soul of the world.
C. here departs even further from the truth in his phrase quae av aqua
cuncta finqeret, implying 8 distinct creation out of inert matter by some
external force. Elsewhere he gives the usual account, Ac. 11 118 Thales ex
aqua dix-ic constare omnia. [Mr Reid would get rid of the inconsistency in
O.'s account of Th. by inserting et between eam and meatem ‘that water was

the first principle, and that it (water) was God and the mind which pro- ·

duced all things out of water '. One would be glad to relieve O. from the
charge of talldng nonsense, but it is 8 question here whether he would
object to put nonsense into the mouth of Vell., audit must be remembered
that we have the evidence of Minucius in favour of the existing reading]
81 di possunt—vacans corpore. The reading of most use, et merite,
cur aquae ach‘wnm’tsti ipsa mem δια, teems with difficulties. To what does
di allude? According to the preceding sentence T. only attributed divinity
to mind, and here we have just the opposite supposition of deities with·
out mind z then we find a transitive verb without an object, and lastly
another supposition as to the possibility of mind existing apart from body,
this suppoffition standing alone as a protasis without an apodosis. If, set-
ting aside the grammatical difficulties, we endeavour to establish 8 general
connexion in thought with what precedea we have to consider whether the
argument is direct, or ad hominem, whether corpus is used in its wider
sense (a matter), or its narrower (⁸- animated body), lastly how we are to
understand the words deus and censue. It will help to clear the ground js
