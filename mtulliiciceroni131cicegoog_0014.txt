impulse in the revulsion from the popular mythology. He con-
demned anthropomorphism and polytheism altogether, and said that
Homer and Hesiod had attributed to the Gods conduct which would
have been disgraceful in men. God is one, all eye, all ear, all
understanding3 he is. for ever unmoved, unchangeable, a vast all-
embracing sphere. See N. D. 1 28. It is disputed whether the
last expression is to be taken literally, implying that the universe
is God, or whether it is a metaphor to express God’s perfection and
omnipresence. The chief representative of the Eleatic School is
Parmenides (b. 515 13.0.). He disengaged the doctrine of Xenophanes
from its theologica-l form, and ascribed to Being what his predecessor
had ascribed to God. His philosophy is the antithesis of that of
Heraclitus. While Heraclitus said all is motion and change, the
appearance of fixity is merely illusion of the senses3 Parmenides
asserted, with distinct reference to him, that all that exists has
existed and will exist the same for ever, that it is change and
multiplicity which is illusory. It is only by thought we can become
conscious of the really existent, being and thought are the same,
sense can only give rise to uncertain opinion. In such language
we see partly a protest against the vagueness of the conception of
development or ‘ becoming,’ by which the Ionic philosophers en-
deavoured to explain the origin of things, ‘You say fire becomes
water, but each thing is what it is, and can never be otherwise ς’
partly an idea of the indestructibility of matter-3 partly an antici-
pation of the later distinction between necessary and contingent
truth3 thus one point dwelt upon by him was the impossibility of
any separation of parts of space.

But though truth only belonged to the world of real existence,
Parmenides condescended to give his romance of nature for the
benefit of those who could not penetrate beyond the world of phe-
nomena. He begins with two principles, light and darkness, also
called fire and earth, or male and female3 and supposes all things
to proceed from their mixture. The existing universe consists of a
central fire, the seat of the presiding Deity, and of several concentric
rings of mingled light and darkness, bounded ou the outside by a
wall of fiame. The first-born of Gods was Love, by whom the union
of opposites is brought about. In this we may trace a reminiscence
of the Haeiodic Ἔρως (N. D. 1 28).

showing the absurd consequences of the ordinary belief in the
