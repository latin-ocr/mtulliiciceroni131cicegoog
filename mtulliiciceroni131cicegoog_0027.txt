existence in his own mind of the ideal form which is subsequently
impressed upon the stone3 (2) the existence of the stone 3 (3) the
process of carving5 (4) the motive which induced the sculptor to
make the statue, as for instance the desire to do honour to the
God whose statue it is. But the opposition of form and matter
is not confined to such simple cases—it covers the whole range of
existence from the First Matter‚ which is mere potentiality of being
at the one extreme, to the First Form which is pure immaterial
actuality, the Divine Being, at the other extreme. The intermediate
links in the chain are matter or form ‚according as they are viewed
from above or below, as marble for instance is form in reference to
stone generally, matter in reference to statue3 vitality is form in
reference to the living body, matter in reference to rationality. God

striving of the universe, of the development of each thing from the
potential into the actual; and this not by any act of creation, for
He remains ever unmoved in His own eternity, but by the natural
tendency which all things have towards Him as the absolutely Good,
the object and end of all effort,· of all desire. The universe itself
is eternal, a perfect sphere, the circumference of which is composed
of the purest clement, ether, and is carried round in circular motion
by the immediate influence of the Deity. In it are the fixed stars,
themselves divine. The lower planetary spheres have a less perfect
movement and are under the guidance of subordinate divinities.
Furthest removed from the First Mover comes the earth which is
fixed in the centro, and composed of the four inferior elements.
still it exhibite a constant progressive movement from inorganic
into organic‚ from plant into animal, from life which is nutritive
and sensitive only into life which is locomotive and finally rational
in man. The human soul is a microcosm uniting in itself all the
faculties of the lower orders of animated existence, and possessing
besides, the divine and immortal faculty of reason. As each thing
attains its end by fulfilling the work for which it is designed by
nature, so man achieves happiness by the nnobstructed exercise of
his special endowment, a rational and virtuous activity. Pleasure
is the natural accompaniment of such an activity. Virtue, which
may be described as perfected nature, belongs potentially to man's
nature, but it becomes actual by the repetition of acts in accordance
with reoeon„ It is subdivided into intellectual and moral, according
as it is a habit of the purely rational part of the soul, or as it is
