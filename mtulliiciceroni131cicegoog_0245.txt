with Madv.’s n. and ib. 72 where Torquatus defends his master’s neglect of
puerile studies 3 also Zeller Stoice tr. p. 397 folL, and Diining Hem-odom
p. 64 foll. on the esteem in which the Epicuream held the pcets. Gassendi
in his treatise De vica ct moribus Epicuri examines at length the charges
here made against Ep. and endeavours to show that they are mere slanders
of rival philosophers. In dealing with such a question, there are two
points which should be borne in mind, (1) that knowledge which has been
systematized and authoritatively taught is liable to a sort of ossification in
the hands of formalists and pedants, and (2) that, as each stesh advance in
knowledge bears more or less the character of a revolt against knowledge
established and authoritative, a certain amount of sels-confidence and want
of appreciation for previous knowledge is not unusual in reformers or dis-
coverers. So Hobbes ‘ boasted of the smallness of his acquaintance with
preoeding writers, declaring that if he had read as much as other men
he should have been as dull of wit as they were ’‚ Whewell Lect. οη Mor.
Phil. p. 43. We may therefore excuse Ep. if he condemned too severely
the artificial poetry, the frivolous rhetoric, and the hair—splitting logie of
his time. If he spoke contemptuously of these as of no use for life, he has
done no more than the Stoic Seneca in his seth epistle, unum studium vere
liberale est quod liberm facit.- cetera pusilla etptaerilia ετιηες and again,
quid quod ista liberalium artiwm comedat-io molestos, verbosos, rhammo-etima,
sibiplaoemes facit, et ideo non demtos necea-saria quia supervacua didice-
runt? as he shows in detail in the same epistle. That the ‘ liberal arts '
were not entirely neglected by the followers of Epicurus appears from the
large number of treatises on rhetoric, music, poetry and dialectic‚ which
have been found among the Herculanean papyri. But Philodemus, to
whom most of them are assigned, shares his master’s contempt for a pro-
fession of universal knowledge (such as was made by Hippias), comparing
the ‘ polyhistore ² of his time to the Homeric MargiteS, see his De Vitis
x col. 20 Ussing p. 55, Rhetorica Gros p. 52. See more under inscitia

other instance of this particular use of fuit, but it may be compared with
such cases as Act. x 16 commodum ad te dederam litteras, cum ad me bene
