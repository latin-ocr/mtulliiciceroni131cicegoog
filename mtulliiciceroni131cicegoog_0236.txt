ἔχοντα διαφοράς, a point in which he differed from Epic. who made the
atoms infinite in number, but limited the variety of shapes, see Lucr. Le.
The text here is extremely doubtful„ Heind.‚ who re-writes the senoenoe,
pertinently asks what is the ‘force of quasi before a simple word such as
adunca. Any. and pyr. are both ὄπ. λεγ.
quaedam—alia—partim—quaedam: cf ξ 103 Tuae. v 38. Similarly
we have modo and tum irregularly combined for the sake of variety in 534.

merely marks the unfamiliarity of commeandum to translate ἄτομος (so first

nulla egaeffitleziiatura, sed concursu quodam fortuito. This is a eor-

rect statement of the theory of Epicurus, but is inapplicable to Democritus,
who spoke of chance as the fiction of human inconsiderateness (ἅνθρωποι τύ-
χης εἴδωλον ‘’afficio-ano πρόφασιν ἰδίης α’βουλίης Mullach p. 167) and said that
nothing was made at random (οὐδὲν χρῖμιι μάτην γίγνεται, ἀλλὰ πάντα ἐκ
λόγου τε καὶ ὑπ’ ἀνάγκης Mullach p. 226). So Arist. Gen. An. V 8 Δημόκριπι·

ad fim ὅλως δὲ τὸ νομίζειν ἀρχὴν εἶναι ταύτην ἱκανήν, ὅτι ἀεὶ ἦ ἔστιν οὗτος ἢ

ais· οὕτω καὶ τὸ πρότερον ἐγίνετο, Which (in Phys. 11 4 and 5) he treats as equs-
valent to making τὸ αὐτόματον the cause. While C. uses the word for-tuitus
of the atoms of Democritus in Tunc. 1 22, 42, Ac. 1 6, as well as here; in the
De Fato 23 and 39, he more correctly connects the universal perpendiculu-
movement of the atoms with the doctrine of fate, id Demea-itus aoet'poee

priusque to quis—dejecerit. The indefinite quin is rarely found ex-

cept m connexion with conjunctions or relative pronouns or with the verb
dixen't, see Zumpt ξ 708, Draeg. ξ 44. [It is not easy to say whether

. dejecerit should be classed as Subj. or Ind.‚ see Gr. ἕξ 1540, 1541. Ι am

inclined to take it as Ind. cf. Liv.vl1 40 vos prim in me strinxeritis feru-am

frequent in these sentences, R]

vitae statu: a common phrase in C„ e. g. Verr. 11 10 ‘the lamenta·
tions of the Siciliane made me abandon my rule of never taking part in a
prosecution’ (de vitae meae statu deducerent nt eqo utum accusarem). Dejt'cen
de statu (Orator 129) 1s a metaphor borrowed from the ring ‘to knock a man
out of his attitude' . ‘It would be easier to make you change your whole
posture of life than to stop you from following his waching '.
