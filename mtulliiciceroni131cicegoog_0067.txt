and giving rise to a wrong pronunciation. He quotes hexameter
lines containing the words obiciebat, conicere, subicit, and says many
readers lengthen the first vowel in order to make the lines acan, but
ob, con and cub are essentially short syllables and only lengthened
by the consonant which follows, secunda enim litera in lais verbis per
duoi, noviper-unum scribenda (κη mmverbwm ipcum‘non est ‘icio'
scd ‘iacio' et praeteritwm non ‘icit’facit, ced ‘iecit'. Id ubi compo-
siam est, ‘a' litera in ‘i' mutatur, sicuti fit in verbis ‘imilio', et
‘ incipio’, atque ‘ita' vim consonantis capit, et idcirco ea syllaba pro·
madius latimque paulo pronuntiata priorem syllabam brevem esce non
patitur. Then he goes on to say that quod apud Vcryilium positvm
invenimus (ἐπίοι’, εἰσ eece ‘iniice', ut supra dixi, et mibondum et
leqmdum sciamus. Ι should wish therefore to keep the spelling
with j in all except the rare cases in which the consonantal i ceases
to exercise any influence on the quantity of the preceding syllable, as
in reice Verg. Ed. 111 96, adicit Mart. x 82 1. In such exceptional
cases the spelling would be changed as in other cases of syncope

or diaeresis.

APPENDIX ΟΝ DAVIES' MSS.

It is a cutious fact that, of the six MSS used by Davies for his
edition of the Natura Deorum, viz. the Codex Reyius, Bp. Moore's
copy of the Stephanus edition containing two marginal collations
(styled by Davies Codices Eliensee), the ns lent to him by Dr Richard
Mead (Med.) and those belonging to the Cambridge University
Library (Cant.) and to the Library of Lincoln College, Oxford (Lina),
all but the two last have disappeared. In order to save trouble to
others who may be interested in the text of Cicer0, and also in the
hope that possibly some one among my readers may be able to sup-
plement my account with further information, 1 print here all that
1 have been able to ascertain about the history of the lost uss,

In the Preface to the lst edition of the MD. 1718, Davies de—
scribes the codd. El. as follows: usum editioni-3 Stephanicae cum
duobus optimis uss collatae dedic summus mei, dum in vivis erat,
pata-onus, Joarmec Morus, nuper Elimeia Episcopus. Ten years
later, in the Preface to his edition of the De Leqibue, he speaks more
