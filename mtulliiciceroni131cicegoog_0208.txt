The same argument is employed in defence of divination Div. 1 11, and met
in the following book (11 39) by a reference to the universality of the desire

(On the philosophy& common eme) esp. ξ vi (Chronoloyvhal sertis ‘ff testimo-
nias), H. Spencer First Principlea p. 4 foll. (who grants the universality of
religious ideas), and the very fair and able discussion in J ellett's Efficacy <ff
Prayer p. 70 foll. and App. on General Consent. The analogous ecclesiasti-
cal doctrine formularized by Vincent of Lerins in the wonds quod ubique,
quod semper, quod ab omnibus creditum est, or in the more sounding phrase
of Augustino secum judicat orbis terrarum, is of far more doubtful value,
as it refers not to the primitive instincts of mankind, but ’ω abstract
dogmas, received on authority, and often very little understood by those

who professed to hold them.
