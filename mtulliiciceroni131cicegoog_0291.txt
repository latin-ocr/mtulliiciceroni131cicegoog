non vereatur—ne intereat. Klotz Adn. Or. 11 19 has well defended
this reading (supported by the quotation in Aug. Ep. 118) against Madv.-
and Ba. whose emendations are inconsistent with the general purport of
the argument, viz. to prove that the Epicurean God is 'not ὀοαειω, it having
been already shown (5 110) that he is not immortalis.

pulsetur—sempiterna: cf. Or. o. Cela. ιν 14 01 τοῦ Ἐπικούρου θεοί,
σύνθετοι ἐξ ἀτόμων τυγχάνοντες, καὶ τὸ ὅσον ἐπὶ τῇ συστάσει ἀνάλυτοι, πραγμα-
τεύονται τὸς φθοροποιοῦς ἀτόμους ἀποσείεσθαι, and my n. on ξ 49. The
argument is fatal to the Gods of the inter-mumdia (see Lucr. v 351 fou),
but there was in all probability a party among the Epicureans who had:
accepted a modification of the less vulnerable Democritian theology (§ 120).
This latter is apparently the view propounded in ξ 49, but the criticism
here is dimcted against the former.

ξ 115. at etiam—everterit ε ‘ but (you reply) Ep. wrote a work on
piety. Yes, but how? In a manner entirely inconsistent with his general
theory, so that you might fancy yourself listening to O. or S! Diog. L. x
27 mentions a treatise of Ep. περὶ ὁσιότητος, and Philod. osten refers to his
teaching on the subject, as in p. 104 ὅτι μὲν ὅρκοις καὶ θεων ε’πιῤῥήσεσιν
ἐδοκίμαζον χρῆσθαι, γελοῖον ὑπομιμνήσκειν, ἀναμέστου τῆς πραγματείας τῶν

πείθεσθαι τοῖς νόμοις καὶ τοῖς ἐθισμοῖς ἕως ἂν μή τι τῶν ἀσεβῶν προστάττωσιν,
p. 125—132 (writing to Phyrson he bide him to sacrifice according to the
lawe, as he himself oboerved the feast of Choes and the Mysten-ies, offering
prayer, not only as a duty enjoined by law, but as a natural offering to
beings surpassing in power and goodness).

Coruncanium: the first plebeian Pont. Max. 252 nc. compared for his
wisdom with Lycurgus, Solon, Cato, &a (De Orat. m 56), noticed as espe-
cially beloved by the gods (N. D. 11 165), as an authority in religious
matters (111 5).

Scaevolam: P. Mucius Sc. (father of O.’s friend and patron the Pont.
Max. Q. ‘Mucius Se.) was consul in 110. 133, the year in which Tib.
Gracchus lost his life, succeeded his brother Mucianus in the Pontificate
nc. 131, so famed for his knowledge of law that he is called one of the
founders of the Jus Οῑίινιῖο, cf. 111 5.
