114 BOOK 1 cn. x1 §28

Though the contrary principle bellum did not play so important a part in
Pes system as in that of Empedocles, yet it may easily have been introduced
in the description of the mingling of Light and Darkness‚ Male and Female,
of which the following lines are preserved to us (R. ἃ Ρ. ξ 151, Mullach
stay. 1 p. 127) ἐν δὲ μέσῳ τούτων δαίμων ἦ πάντα κυβερνᾷ. Ι πάντῃ γὰρ
στυγεροῖο τόκου καὶ μίξιος ἀρχὴ Ι πέμπουσ’ ἄρρενι θῆλυ μιγῆναι, ἐναντία
δ’ αὖθις Ι ἄρσεν θηλυτέρῳ. A fragment of Philodemus probably refers to
this part of P.’s doctrine, as the name Παρμενείθης occurs just before (p.
65), τόν τε πρῶτον θεὸν ἄψυχον ποιεῖν, τούς τε γεννωμένους ὑπὸ τούτου τὰ
μὲν αὐτὰ τοῖς πάθεσιν τοῖς· περὶ ἀνθρώπους. From this we may explain

the Epicurean polemio in the text: ‘ if P. deified human passions our
experience shows that these are liable to be affected by disease, sleep,
old age, ἀεὶ

them divine, cf. §119adrationemrevocatQDia 11 66 caterua ad conjec-

eademque—omittantur. Parm. is said to have written largely περὶ
ἔστ-ρων but we are not told elsewhere that he attributed divinity to them.
On the omission of dicit (with eadem) cf. ξ 17 n. The reference is to ad
deum revocet. In alio i. e. in the case of Alcmaeon.

collected and explained by Karsten (very full notes), Mullach and others.
Lucretius 1 716—733 speaks in a very different tone of ‘ the glory of Sicily
whose inspired verses set forth his discoveries in such wisc ut via· humana
videatur stirpe matu-s ’, but we learn from N. D. 1 93 that Epicurus and
some of his disciples wrote against him. In Ac. 11 '74 C. says of him
diqnabsimpm relnoe iis dc quibus loquitur sonum femderc videtur. The
numerous fragments of E.’s poem περὶ φύσεως show how capi-iciously the
authority, whom C. follows, selected his facts. In addition to the four
elementa, deified under the names of Ζεύς or Ἥφαιστος (fire), Ἤρη (air),
pffycne (water), Αῖδωνεός (earth) E. treats as divine the active principles
Νεῖκος· and Φιλότης (also called Ἀφροδίτη), the all-including Sphere Σφαῖρος
(ὁ εὐδαιμονέστατος θεός Arist. Met. 111 4), the supreme Law (Auci-7111), the
gods and daemone of the popular religion, the souls of good men. The
criticism is equally careless.

whole a fair criticism of the system of Empedocles in 1 752-802, urges the
same objection, but Ε. himself distinctly asserts the opposite, φύσις οὐδενός
