immediate sensuous impraesion produced on the mind when its fine atoms

are struck by the cognate atoms which constitute the divine inmqivm,
atoms which pass unpereeived through the coarser sieve of the bodily

aenaea, but also to the conception of blessedness and immortality to which
the mind attains by reflecting upon the impressions it has received. It is
the latter procem which is properly expressed ΒΥ cogitatio.

nee soliditate—appellat. At first sight it seems natural to take aot. as
an abl. of cause after carnatus-5 and so Sch. explains it by a reference to
the distinction between the imaqims thrown off from solid bodies (the στε-
ρέμνια), which imagines aro described in Diog. L. X 46 as ἇπόῤῥοωι τὴν ἑξῆς
θέσιν καὶ τάξιν διατηροῦσαι, ἥνπερ καὶ ἐν τοῖς στερεμνίοις εἶχον, and a finer
class of imagines which reveal to us the shadowy form of the Gods. The
expression would not be quite accurate, for even the finest images must in
the end consist of atoms (since all that existe is summed up under atoms
and void, according to Epic.) and soliditas is essential to atoms of every
kind 3 still in popular language (quadam-eut ita de'cam) it might be said
that the images perceived by the bodily senses were perceived in virtue
of a massiveness which was not shared by the images which were per·
ceptible ΒΥ the mind alone. The objections to this interpretation are
(1) that it really adds nothing to what has been already said in the
previous clause, though apparently contrasted with it by the word primam,
(2) that it is difficult to connect it with what follows, (3) that it is incon·
sistent with the words of § 105 mc esse in ea (specte) ullam soliditatem,
mque eandem ad numerum permanere, in which the absence of soliditas is
predicated of the divine form itself‚ not of the image, as distinguished from
the form, in virtue of which negative property the image is pereeived in a
pmtimilar way. Accordingly Peter (Commutatio de N. D. Saarbriicken 1861)
and Hirzel take soliditate quadam as a predicative Abl. of quality, of which
the former cites several exx. (N. D. 1 12 veris falsa ach'uncta tanta cimanu-
dine, 28 continente ardore lucis orbem, 81 reliquos deos ea facie novimus, 84

nitndinc neque derna juba, adfer-coitate oculorum φῑοπάονο prodita. Taking
soliditate thus as referring to the substance of the deity which has nilla
concreti, nihil solidi in it (ξ 75), it is opposed to the previous clause which
referred to the mode in which that substance was perceived. It cannot be
denied that there is something very harsh in the construction of such an
Abl. with cernatur, and I think it possible that cit may have been lost aster
numerum before ut. The term στερέμνιον occurs repeatedly 111 the frag-
ments of Epic. περὶ φύσιος and' 111 his Epistle to Herodotus preserved 111
