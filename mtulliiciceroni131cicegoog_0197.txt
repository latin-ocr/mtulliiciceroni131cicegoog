Strato : (Krische 349-358, Oudworth 1 144—153). He succeeded Th. as
head of the Lyceum nc. 287, and changed the theism of Aristotle into a
system variously described as pantheistic or atheistic. Cudworth calls him
‘the first asserter of hylozoic atheism ², and says that while ‘nature according
to Democritus was the fortuitous motion of matter, Strato’s nature was an
inward plastic life in the several parts' of matter, whereby they could arti-
ficially frame themselves to the best advantage according to their several
capabilities without any conscious or reflexive knowledge' ς a view which
appears closely to resemble the ordinary notion of Evolutionism. Cic. says
of him that he is omnino semovendus from the true Peripatetics, as he
abandoned ethics, and demd very widely from his predecemrs in
physics,to which branch he confined himself3 again, Ac. 11 121 Strato myas

standing he was an opponent of the atomic philosophy. Similar views are
advocated by the Academic Cotta N. D. 111 27.

minuendi: some edd. insert aster this immutandi, a correction of im-
mittendi which occurs in one or two use, but it is probable that this is
merely due ιο a careless repetition of the preceding word.

careat-ficara: of course from the Epicurean point of view, cf. n. on
species ξ 34; but, as Strato, according to Plutarch adv. ool. c. 14, denied
that the world was a living creature, careat semu is probably correct in
this case. Strato's dem seems ιο have been much the same as Prof. Tyn-
dal’s Μαίων ‘ containing the promise and the potency of all existence’.

ch. xlv ξ 36. The absence of any allusion to the previous criticism
of the Stoic philosophy in ἐξ 18-24, just as in the parallel case of the
Platonic philosophy ξ 30, is an instance of the carelessneae which charac-
terizes the composition of the whole treatise, and particularly of the present
(historical) section.

zeno: (Krische ass—404, Brandis in Dict. of moa). He is quoted
N. D. 11 57 (definition of nature), 20 (arguments to prove the rationality of
the world), also in 1 70, 11 63, 111 18, 22, 63.

naturalem legem. Heraclitus was the first who expressly identified
the law of nature with the word and will of God 3 cf, Fr. 91 Bywater, ξυνόν
ἐστι πᾶσι τὸ φρονέειν· ξὺν νόῳ λε’γοντας ἰσχυρίζεσθαι χρὴ τᾷ ξυνῷ πάντων,
ὅκωσπερ νόμῳ πόλις καὶ πολὺ ῖσχυροτίρως. Τρέφονται γὰρ πάντες· 02 ἀνθρά-
πειοι νόμοι ὑπὸ {ves τοῦ θείου* κρατέει γὰρ τοσοῦτον ὅκοσον ἐθέλει καὶ ἐξαρκίει

Ῑδίην ἔχοντες φρόνησιν. fr. 65 ἓν τὸ σοφὸν μοῦνον λέγεσθαι οὐκ ε’θέλει καὶ
ἐθέλει, Ζηνὸς οὕνομα. This view, popularized by the Stoics, was passed on
by them to the Roman jurists and so to their modern successors. Thus
