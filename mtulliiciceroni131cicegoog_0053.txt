5 110, 1116 approving mention, slightly veiled it is true under an
Academic form, of the Stoic doctrine of the divinity of the universe

5 95, and of the teleological argument 5 100. Schwencke carries
the argument further than this. He notices certain marks which
indicate a more or less close following of his authority on the part
of Cicero, such as the introduction of quotations from Latin authors,
allusions to Roman customs, to other writings of his own, dvo. 3 and
in reference to this particular section, which professes to be a reply
to what has gone before, he remarks that it is very unlikely that
O. could have met with an independent treatise‚ whether Academic
or Stoic‚ which should just meet and refute the arguments in the
Epicurean treatise used by him for the earlier sections 3 that pre-
cise references therefore to the preceding argument are probably
additions by O.; and from this he draws the conclusion that the last
part of Cotta’s speech, from 5 115 to the end, has undergone least
manipulation and most faithfully represents the original authority3
and it is precisely here that we find the largest amount of Stoio
matter. Again‚ noticing the remarkable break after ξ 105, where
Cicero after proposing to consider the question of 1116 abode and
manner of life of the gods in 5 103, suddenly recurs to their nature,
leaving the previous question altogether unanswered, he suggests
that we have here a fragment of the original, which O. began to
translate, but found to be unsuited to his purpose of meeting the
speech of Velleius and forgot afterwards to cancel. Here again there
are marked indicatione of a Stoie origin, as I have pointed out in
my notes on the bestiae quae ique maci putemur, and on naturae
accommdacum.

There are however some arguments which need consideration in
favour of the Academio origin of the section. Thus Hirzel has
pointed out the close resemblance between parts of this and the
sceptical argument in Sext. Emp. 113 also the inconsistenoy between
Cotta’s statement as to the superstition of Epicurus 5 85, and that
which is quoted from Posidonius in 5123 3 and lastly the anti-Stoie
sentimenta which we find interspersed, e. g. the repeated profession
of agnosticism 557, 66, 84, 91, 94, the contempt for the consensus
qentium 5 62, the objection to the rationalizing and allegorizing of
the myths 5 119. 'Sweneke replies with considerable force that
Sextus has himself borrowed from a Stoio original in such passages
as lx 123 and 1313 that we find the opposing views as to the
sincerity of Epicurus’ religious belief stated in Sext. Emp. 11 58 and
