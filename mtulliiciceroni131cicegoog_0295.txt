ξ 18 to Democritus in ξ 19, Schwenoke (p. 61) thinks that Ο. here departs
from his author (as he often does where he wishes to cnliven the discussion
by a quotation) perhaps through a reminiscence of Tmo. 1 29 quaem quorum
demonstrentur sepulcra in Graecia, reminsem, quoniam es amitinus, quae
tradantur myster-inb, where the tombs of the gods are also brought into
juxtaposition with the mysteries. On the general subject of the mysteries‚
see Dollinger l. o. leo—200, and Lobeck Aqlaophamm.

leam from ίῳ. 11 36, where the beneficial influence of the mysteries is

ubi initiantur—ultimae. It 1s not known from whence this iambic
line is taken. orarum is the Inclusive (partitive) Genitive after ultimae,
which I take as Nom. Pl. agreeing with ymas, not (as Sch. apparently) as
-Geu, Sing. It is loosely added, like loom-wc, terrarum, δια, to define the
meaning of ult. With regard to the admission to the mysteriea Isocrates
..Pansa 42 mentions that barbarians were not allowed to be initiated, but
therule seems to havebeenrelaxed in latertimes,as in the case of (3.3
Ο indeed Lobeck considers that any one already initiated was at liberty

to introduce a friend of whatever nationality (p. 28 foll), so that the word
μυσταγωγός came to mean no more than cicerone. But the form of initia·
tion was always required, the uninitiated could only enter the temple at
the peril of their lives, as is shown by the fate of the two Acarnaniam
whose death led to the war between Athens and Macedonia Ro. 200
(Liv. ΗΠ 14).

Samothraciam—Lemni: these islanda together with Imbros were
the seat of the Oabiric worship, on which see Don. 1. o. p. 164 foll„ Lobeck
qu. p. uos—1329, Preller Gr. Hytla 1 660—673. Herodotus 11 51 is the
first who mentions the Samothracian mysteries. Preller thinks that these
were not of much importanoe till after the Persian War, and that they
were partly copied from the Eleusinia. Aristophanes (Pax 278) speaks of
the Samothracian initiation as a safeguard in danger; especially at sea, as
we learn from other sources, cf. N. D. 111 89. Under the Macedonian and ·
Roman rule (partly owing to the supposed connexion of Rome with Troy)
these myster-ies were continually growing in importanoe. See Liv. ΗΝ. 5,
