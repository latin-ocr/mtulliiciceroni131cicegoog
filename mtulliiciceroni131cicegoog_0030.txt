Carthage, Persaeus, who like his master was a native of Citium
(N. D. 1 38), Aratus of Soli in Cilicia, the author of two astronomical
poems translated by Cicero (N. D. 11 104—115). Cleanthes was
succeeded by Chrysippus of Soli (b. 280, d. 206), who developed and
systematized the Stoie philosophy (N. D. 1 39 al.). N ext came
Zeno of Tarsus, and Diogenes of Babylon, one of the three ambas-
sadors to Rome in 155 ne. From this time foi-ward Stoicism begins
to show a sostened and eclectic tendency, as we may see in Panaetius
of Rhodes (180--111 B.c.)‚ the friend of Scipio and Laelius, whose
work περὶ τοῦ καθήκοντος formed the basis of the De Officiis (N. D.
11 ξ 118), and also in his pupil Posidonius of Apamea in Syria, who
was one of Cicero's instructore (N. D. 1 7 ὅτι 123, 11 88), and from
whom much of the Stoic argumentation in the N. D. is probably
derived.
, “ The end of philosophy with the Stoics was purely practical.
Philosophy is identical with virtue. But since virtue consiste in
bringing the actions into harmony with the general order of the
world, it is essential to know what this order ie, and thus we arrive
at the famous triple division of philosophy into physice, including
cosmology and theology, which explains the nature and laws of the
univers03 loqic, which ensures us against deception and supplies
the method for attaining to true knowledge; ethice, which drawa the
conclusion for practical life. The chief point of interest inthe Logic
of the Stoice is their theory as to the evicerim. They considered
the soul to resemble a sheet of blank paper on which impressions
(φαντασίαι) were produced through the senece. The concept (ἔννοια)
was produced from the impressions by generalization, which might
be either spontaneous and unconscious, giving rise to common ideas
or natural anticipatione (κοιναὶ ἔννοιαι, ἔμφυτοι προλήψεις), 01· it might
be consciens and methodical, giving rise to artificial concepte. In
entire opposition to Plato they held that the individual object alone
had red existence ; the universal, the general term, existed only in

, the mind as subjective though t. The truth or falsehood of these

impressione and conceptions depended on their possession of τὰ
καταληπτικόν, the power of carrying conviction. An impression
which was not merely assented to, but forced itself irresistibly on
the mind, was a καταληπτικὴ φαντασία, a perception that has a firm
grasp of reality. The same irresistible evidence attaches to a πρό-
ληψις, but artificial concepte required to have their truth proved by
being connected with one or other of these criteria.
