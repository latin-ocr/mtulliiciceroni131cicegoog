ἔστιν, οὗθ’ ἁπλοῖς, οὔτ’ ἐν γᾷ μανῷ, οὔτε δύναμει, Le. void does not exist either
separately or inclosed in bodies as a cause of rarefaction)‚ see also cleomedes

there was an infinite vacuum Diog. vn 140, Zeller Stoica tr. p. 185—192.
Dr Whewell (Smbntfflc Idea-5 11 48—63) while allowing the value of the
molecular hypothesis as an instrument of discovery, points out many diffi-
culties which stand in the way of our accepting it ‘as a philosophical truth
respecting the constitution of the universe '; cf. also Veitch Lucretius and
the Atomic Theory and Clerk Maxwell's Art. on ‘ Atom ' in the Encyc. Brit.
As to the existence of vacuum the results of modern science are thus stated,
‘ the undulatory theory of light supposes the whole of the celestial spaces to
be filled with the luminiferous ether. The astronomical argument therefore
in favour of absolute vacuum has fallen ; but the views of the constitution
of matter which have grown with the rise of the molecular sciences of
chemistry, light, heat, electricity‚ &c., have supplied its place with much
more effect. The inference to which the modern philosophy would give
the greatest probability is that all space is occupied by perticles of matter
with vacuous interstices, showing an degrees of density ³. Enqlish Cyclo-

believing that Cotta’s speech is borrowed from a Stoic source, but O. adds
clauses like this to impert to it an Academic colouring.

flagitia: ‘atrocities'3 so just below and 111 91, cf. the use of monstra,
portenta, &c ξ 18 n.: one may excuse such scurrilities in the mouth of the
DogmatistS, but they are scarcely appropriate for an Academic. The con·

Epicurus denied that Leucippus had ever existed, Diog. L. x 13, Hirzel

corpuscula—adunca. Lucretius Π 333 foll. shows how the qualities of
bodies are derived from the various shapes of the constituent atoms, some
