world which he creates, while Pronoea is strictly an attribute of the fiery
soul which animates the world, and from which the world grows as a plant

11 118) that it was destined ιο be destroyed by fire. The answer is that
this destruction is merely the cyclical re-absorption of the universe, as
it grows old, into its original form of fire, from which it issues forth in
renovated strength and beauty.
