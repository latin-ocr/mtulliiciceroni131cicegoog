a habit of the emotional part which is capable of being influenced
by reason, but not itself rational. Every natural impulse is the
potentia] basis of a particular virtue which may be developed by
repean actions freely performed in accordanoe with the law of
mason so as to avoid either excess or defect. Since man is by

nature gregariouS, his perfection is only attainable in society, and
ethical science is thus subordinate to political science (N. D. 1 33, 11
42, 44, 95, aL).

The later Peripatetics are of no great importance. Cicero men-
tions in the N. D. Aristotle's immediate follower Theophrastus
(N. D. 1 35), whose treatise on Friendship is copied in the Laelius ,-
and Strato (N. D. 1 35), who suooeeded Theophrastus as head of
the school in the year 288 no. Critolaus was one of the three philo-
sophers who were sent by the Athenians as ambassadors to Rome
in the year 155 Β.ο., and whose coming first introduced the Romans
to the new world of philosophy. Cratippus presided over the school
during the lifetime of Cicero, who sent young Marcus to Athens to

attend his lectures.

To return now to the Academy, this is divided into three
scliools‚ the Older, the Middle and the New Academy*. To the
'first belong the names of Speusippus (1 32), Xenocrates (1 34) and
Polem0, who successively presided over ‚the school between 347 and
270 B.c., as well as those of Heraclides of Pontus (1 34), Crantor
and Crates. They appear to have modified the Platonic doctrines
mainly by the admixture of Pythagorean elementa Crantor's writiugs
were used by Cicero for his Consolatio and Tusculan Disputations.
The chief expounders of the Middle Academy were its founder
Arcesilaus 315—241 B.0. (1 11, 70), carneades of Cyrene 214—129
nc. (1 4, 11 65, 111 44), one of the Athenian ambassadors to Rome in
155 Β.ο., and Clitomachus of Carthage‚ his successor in the presi·
dency. They neglected the positive doctrine of Plato, and employed
themselves mainly in a negative polemio against the dogmatism of
the Stoics, professing to follow the example of Socrates, though

¹* Cicero only recognized the Old and the New Academy, the latter cor·
responding to what is above called the Middle Academy‚ but including Philo.
Antiochus himself claimed to be a true representative of the Old Academy.
Later writers made five Academia schools, the 2nd founded by Arcesilas, the 3111
by Carneades, the 4th by Philo, the 5th by Antiochus.
