BOOK 1 cn. v ξ 11. 77

pateremur qui non Latinis litteris illustratus pateret ; Tmo. 11 1 difficae ed in
philosophia pauca esee ei nota cui non eim aut pleraque auc omnia.
C. accepted the tripartite division, of post-Aristotelian philosophy, into
ἠθική (under which may be grouped the De Finibus, De Officiis, Tm-
culcmae Disputationes, De Leqibm, De Republica, Laelius, Galo, Paradoaea),
διαλεκτική (discussed in the Academica, with which may be ‘connected the
rhetorical treatises, me Ac. 1 32), φυσική (ιο which belong the present
treatise and its adjuncts the De Divinatione and Do Pam: see Fin- Π 3,
v 4, Ac. 1 19, De Orat. 1 68, Leq. 1. 23.

membra: so De Orat. 11 79 quinque faciunt quasi membra eloquemiae.

8118 01 alia: ‘ mutually ', so ξ 54 aliae alias apprehendentes.

aptae: the proper passive force, as in Tmo. v 62 ⁴cladium saeta equina
aptungN. D.m4aptaintereeeeeccohaeremia, ίῳ. 156, Τωσ. 1740.

ch. v. ξ 10. qui requirunt...curios1us faciunt: ‘those who want to
know my own private opinion on each point, show themselves more inqui-

sitive th'an there is any need for ’. See Madv. Pin. 1 3.

auctores: Heind. reads auam-utam with B, quoting 111 10 tu auctori-
tates momnis, ratione puqnan, My. Man. 51 and L09.136 et aciltbettua
libertas disserendi amissa cst, auc tu is es qui in disputando non tuum judi-
cium sequare, sed auctoritati aliorum pareas. We find the same sentiment
in Min. F. 16 and in Jerome as there quoted by the editors.

momenta: ‘ weight of argument ², lit. ‘ what turns the scale ἰ Cf. Ac. 1
45 cum in eadem re paria contrariis in partibas momenta rationum inveni-
rentur, facilius ab utraque parte artemio mtiwetur.

ipse dixit=a23r52 ἔφη, ‘ the mester said it ’. So Socrates is referred ιο
as αὐτός by his disciples in the Nubes 196, cf. Diog. L. vm 1, 46. Both
the Greek and Latin pronouns are used colloquially by slaves of their
masters. Bentham coined the word tpse-dixittlnm to express excessivo
deference ιο authority. It was the boast of the Academics ιο be nullius
addam· jurare in verba mayistri, see Tmo. v 83, Ac. 11 8, 120, Grote’s Plato
1 238 foll.

ξ 11. quattuor Academicis: see Reid’s Introduction ιο the Aca-
demica p. xxxi foll. There were two editions, the first appeared in two
books, entitled Catulus and Damasus, in the spring of 45 Rc„ the second,
which was divided into four books and dedicated ιο Varro, was published
in the following August. We possess only the Dacullue and chapters 1—12
of the first book of the second edition.

lucem desiderant: ‘ the doctrines do not perish though they want the
light that might be thrown upon them by'a living expositor '. Auctoris:
subjective genitive, like lucem inqenii pon-iqentem et tendentem, De Orat.
1 184. For the meaning of auctor here cf. Off. 11 8, where Ο. says of his son
then studying the tenets of the Peripatetics under Cratippus at Athens, in
amiquissim philosophia Cratippo auctore verearis. The expositor, no less
than the founder, may add weight ιο the doctrine by the authority of
his name.
