trorum arae. Lobeck denies that there was any difference between the
Samothracian and Lemnian mysteries1. The latter are only mentioned
here and in another passage from the Philoctetes of Attius quoted by
VarroL. L. vnlllemmkzpraesto Ι litora ramat oelsaG'abirmnldelubra

p. 173.

nocturno—densa: anapaestic dimeter followed by the verm paroe-
miacm; probably a quotation from the Philoctetes of Attius. ‘those rites

which are celebrated at Lemnos in nightly processioa deep shrouded in
their leafy covert’ (silvestribus saepibus densa a sort of hypallage for detuit·
savis saepta).

quibus explicatis—deorum. Compare 111 63 on the allegorizing of
the Stoice. The mysteries themselves appear to have been a kind of
miracle play illustrative of the story of Demeter and of other deities‚
such as Zagreus, who were in later times associated with her. It is doubtful
whether the symbolical action was accompanied by any authorized inter·
pretatiom but philosophers and moralists sought to explain the myster-ies
in such a manner as to recommend their own views. While the ordinary
spectator, satisfied with the splendid and impressive soenes which passed
before his eyes, carried away with him no distinct ideas beyond the
suggestion of a future life of happiness which was in store for the
initiated‚ the Stoice (as Dollinger says, p. 198) regarded them as symboliz-
ing the truth that the gods were merely a portion of the material universe5
the Peripatetics as showing that God had laid the foundation of civilimtion‚
in agriculture 3 the Euhemerists that the objects of worship were only
deified men, · the Pythagor-eane and New Platonists that the secoet of all-
religione was contained in the ancient theology of Egypt and the East„
Plutarch expressly says that he who would rightly understand and profit by
the mysteries must take with him λόγον’ εκ φιλοσοφίας μυσταγωγῶν (Ie. c. 68).
For exx. of the ‘physical interpretation’ here referred to by Ο. cf.
Lobeck 1. c. p. 136 foll„ who quotes Themistius Or. 29 for the view of
Prodicus that the mysterius only referred to the operatione of agriculture3
similarly Cornutus c. 28, aud Varro (ap. Aug. θ’. D.V11 20) V. de Eleusiniis
ἰε’-1112 imerpretatur πίει· quod attinet ad frumeutunu Proserpinam dicit

in Linq. Lat. v 58, terra enim et caelum„ ut Samothracum initia docem
eunt Dei Magni et 122' quoe dim‘ matis mminibm; so Plut. (εἷ ap. Delph-
p. 389) speaks of the Zagreus myth as symbolizing the divine soul of the
world which is ever clothing itself in new shapes.
