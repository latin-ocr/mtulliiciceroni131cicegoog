eeleritate. As the earth was generallyassumed tobeatrestinthe -

centro of the universe it was supposed that the heavens made a complete
revolution about it every 24 hours. Aristarchus (280 Β.ο.) propounded the
Oopernican or heliocentric hypothesis, and was charged with impiety by
cleanthes as κινοῦντα τοῦ κόσμου τὴν ἑστίαν. Hicetas the Pythagoreen
(about 400 Β. c.) and Heraclides of Pontus (350 Β. ο.) are said to have

quodque—in deo. The natural way of taking this sentence is cer-
tainly to suppose that it continues the argument against a rotatory God.
{The motion would be destructive of the tranquillity we ascribe to God,
and, if we may judge from our own feeling& it would also be very uncom·
fortable'. But then how are we to explain the em'm of the next sentence?
for the earth is supposed to be immovab103 it is the mundus which moves.
Sch. therefore following Madv. En. m 73, understands que as passing on
to another point in the argument, and makes the clause refer to the
