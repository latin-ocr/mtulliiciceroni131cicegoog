The question οἱ authorship was thus supposed to be settled, and
for several years the fragment was generally referred to as the περὶ
φύσεως of Phaedrus ¹3 but in 1862 it appeared in the 2nd. vol. of the
new series of Herculamnsia published at Naples, ,εει a portion of a
much larger whole (12 columns out of 147) bearing the name Φιλο·
δήμου ΠΕρι εὐσεβείας of which the thme capital letters alone are now
legible. Whether the remainder were restored from faint traces or
on conjecture merely, is not stated 3 the fact that the volume is found
in a collection containing many writings which are undoubtedly by
Philodemus, and the marked resemblance of style between those
writings and the present' make it at all events highly probable that
it is rightly attributed to him⁸. What then do we know of this
Philodemus beyond the fact of his connexion with Piso? Cicero
speaks of him as a man of elegance and taste, distinguished in litera·
ture no less than in philosophy, non philosophia solum, sed etiam
litteris, quod fere ceteros Epicureos myle90re dicunt, perpolitus (In
Pis. 70); and in the de Finibus 11 119 Torquatus, the Epicurean
speaker, mentions him as an authority to whom difficult questions
may be referred. 'I'hat he had studied the history of philosophy is
shown by an allusion in Diog. L. 1 3 to the l3th book τῆς τῶν
φιλοσόφων συντάξεως written by him. Zeller states (Stoice tr. p. 390),
that not less than 36 treatises by him have been discovemd at Hercu-
laneum⁴. He was much influenced by Zeno, whose disciple he was,

καὶ λόγους τῶν ἇντιδοξαζόντων τοὺς ἐκκειμένους προεφέρετο καὶ τοιαύταις
ἀπαντήσεσι πρός αὐτοὺς ἐχρῆτο, also p. 26, and cf. the reference to Z.'s
lecturas in the περὶ εὐσεβείας p. 118 Gomp. [αἱ] Ζήνωνι γενόμεναι
συναγωγαὶ διασαφοῦσιν 3 some of his treatises are professedly based
upon those of Zen0‚ e. 9. Petersen p. 8, mentions one under the Latin
title De moribus ac vitiis, opus σω libro Zenonis contractum; the
Herculanean vol. vl, Naples 1839, contains another entitled περὶ τῆς
τῶν θεῶν εὖστοχουμένης διαγωγῆς κατὰ Ζήνωνα; and in the preface to

on AEsch. Aa. 1. 362, and in the Italian Bullet. Archeoloq. for 1835 p. 46.
