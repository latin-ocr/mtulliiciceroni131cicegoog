Protagoras: see Krische 130—142. The theological views of P. are
stated again in ἐξ 63 and 117, but without the words qualesve sint, which are
also omitted by Diog. L. 11 51 περὶ μὶν θεῶν οὐκ ἔχω εἰδέναι ow ὥς εῑσὶν οὗθ’
ὥς οὐκ εἰσίν· πολλὰ γὰρ τὰ κωλύοντα εἰδέναι, ἥ τε ἀδηλότης καὶ βραχὺς ὧν ὁ
βίος τοῦ ἀνθρώπου. The first writer who gives the fuller form is Timon the
Sillograph (Β. ο. 279) quoted by Sext. Emp. 11 57 11. θεοὺς κατέγραψ οὔτ’
εἰδέναι οὔτ-ε δύνασθαι Ι dnn-oio! τινές εἶσι καὶ οἵτινες ἀθρήσασθαι. It 18
probable that Philodemus reported the doctrine in this form, for though
there is no direct mention of Prot. in the existing fragments, yet in the
summary at the end of the controversial portion of his 11881188, allusion is
made to τοὺς ἄγνωστον εἴ τινές εἰσι θεοὶ λέγοντας, ἦ ποῖοί τινές εἰσιν,
p. 89, which can only refer to him.

habere quod liqueat z ‘to be able to make up his mind'. cf. 11 3 σι’
haberem aliquid quod liqueret, Ac. 11 94, and the legal N. L. (awa. § 76).

quit-,qnam suspicari: ‘to have the saintest idea’.

Democritus: see Krische 142—163, and nn. on N. D. 1 120 where his
theology is more fully discussed. Epic. is charged with ingratitude towards
him § 93. Lucretius though often dissenting from himin points of detail

always speaks with respe‘ct of that Democriti quod sancta viri mummia
ponit.

unfrequqntly we find a complex idea misinterpreted by being thus broken
