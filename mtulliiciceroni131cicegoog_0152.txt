Madv. Pin„ 1 19 and 30, Ac. 1 28 and 41. In the present sentence however
there was a Subj. previous ιο subordination (multa sunt probabilia quac Ιια-
boant), the relative having a definitive, and not merely a connective force. It
is only a certain kind of probabilia, of a very distinct appearance and there-
fore leaving on the mind a distinct impressiom which can afford practica]
guidance. Again there is a third difficulty if we read exsistit with the
majority of uss, Ι think Klotz (Anu. orit. 1v 5) is right in saying
that the pronoun (illud) may carry back the thought to a past time (in
this case ιο the writing of the Academica alluded ιο just before in the
words alio loco) and so justify the following Imperf„ ct Ac. Π 86 jam illa

esse eloquentes, cf. Draeger ξ 152, Madv. Pin„ 111 67, also Fin. 11 21, 34, 42,
1v 20, Div. 11 96. [The phrase kim vobis exstitit occurs also ξ 55 where it
is followed by Pres. Subj. ut quicq-uid accidat austum dicans, which how-

· ever is probably to be explained as an attraction ιο the parenthetic Pres.

(quoem dicam] Heind„ found another stumblingblock in the form visus
instead of visum, O.‘s regular equivalent for φαντασία : Wolf met the objec—
tion by instancing similar double forms, but the fact is that we want here
a distinct word for a distinct thing. Vnum is a particular effect of the
abstract visus, which has both the active and passive force of our word
‘'.look Habeo could only be used with the latter (cf. hab. venet-acimum
ξ 45) not with the n. vuum. of course vum has here a wide sense given
ιο it corresponding to the use of visum for sensation in general. Lastly
Η. alleges that the clause is superfluous and too technical. Kl. rightly
answers that without it the thought would be left incomplete. It is not
enough to say that true and false impressione are almost indistinguishable:
that by itself would confirm the opponent's charge that the Academica.
leave themselves no grounds for action: you must go on ιο affirm the
existence of probable impressions marked out from others by their clear-
ness‚ so as ιο afford sufficient practical guidance ιο the wise. Compare
with the whole the very similar passage Ac. 11 99 quicquid acciderit specie
