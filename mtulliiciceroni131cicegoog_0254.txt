name Λύκος occurs in one of his fragments (58 R), where Bergk proposes to
emend this passage by inserting Lyci before pueri. As it stands, it is s
broken hexameter, which might be completed by reading amantem for Alc.
Probably C. altered the verse to suit his context, as in ξ 13.

in the consulship and joint-commender in the war against the Cimbri

N. D. 111 80. His uprightness of character is witnessed to by the seying
(Orat. 11 173) Ιιοο verum est, divit enim Q. Catulus, and C. continually preises
his purity and elegance of style both in Greek and Latin (Or. 11 28, Brut.
132). He is one of the speakers in the De Oratore, where some of his witty
sayings are reported (Orat. 11 220 and 278). Gellius xvm 9 quotes with

ful youth Theotimus. The younger Catulus was a warm supporter of Ο.
