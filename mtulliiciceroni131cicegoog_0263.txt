in deorum numero ponere: for const. me §29 n. Numero is Walker’s

corr. for namra of uss [written πᾶ in U and therefore easily confounded
with πό. J. S. RJ.

numquam vidi—figura: see ξ 48 and ξ 76.

qiud ‘1 nolis—vidisti? O. has made a meffl of his argument- Ep. says
‘ I do not believe in the existence of reason apart firom human shape, for
I have no experienee of it '. The answer is ‘You have never seen any thing
like the sun and stars moving in regular order, therefore you must disbelieve
their existence’. of course the cases are entirely unlike: in the latter case
the sensea, which (acc. to Ep.) always tell truth, assert the existence of the
sun ; in the former they assei-t nothing, and we have to proceed by general
reasoning from analogy. What C. was really aiming at may be gathered
from the remarkable treatise of PhilodemQ περὶ σημείων καὶ wacceio-eor,
where we find it stated (p. 37 Gomp.) that ‘the opponente of Epic„ in
arguing that there may be unique existences in the unseen world, are
employing the Epicurean argument from analogy', and (in p. 19) that
‘ Epicureans allow that ἥλιος εἷς ἐστιν ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ καὶ σελήνη καὶ πλῆθος
ἄλλων ὑπάρχον ἶδιοτήτων (Θ. g. the magnet as contrasted with other sivones),
but they hold that when certain properties have been found constantly
united, where one existe the other will exist, μηδένας ἅνθέλκοντος’. The
anti-Epicurean argument therefore must evidently have been of this
nature, ‘there may be rational beings without human shape, though our
experience presente no parallel, for many things in our experienee are un-
paralleled‚ and, on this principle, would have been incredible prior to
experience'.

quinque errantium: so Milton speaks of ‘five other wandering fires’,
viz. Mars, Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn‚ ωε Ν. D. 11 ξ 52 fou.

801 duabus—conficit: ‘the sun completos his annual revolutions, con-
fining his motion within the limits of the ecliptic at either solstice' (lit. ‘by
the two extreme points of one circle')‚ cf. 11 49, 50, 101 fou.

hanc: ‘under similar limitations'3 see 11 50 in lunae quoque curru est et
brumae quaedam et solstitii similitudo,
lustrationem: cf. the use of lustro in 11 53, 106.
