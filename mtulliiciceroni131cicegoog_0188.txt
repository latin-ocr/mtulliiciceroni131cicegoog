Diogenes (Krische 163—177) distinctly attributed reason to the air,
making it the principle of life and understanding in man, and the sovereign
of the universe3 in his own words quoted by Simplicius (R. and P. §63
foll.) ἄνθρωπος καὶ τὰ ἄλλα ζῷα εἷναι-νέοντο (qiu τῷ ἀέρι· καὶ τοῦτο αὐτοῖσι
καὶ ’ψυχή ἐστι καὶ νόησις 2...κώ μοι δοκέει ὑπὸ τούτου πάντα κυβέρνᾶσθαι.
We also learn from Theophrastus that he attributed sensation to air
(R. and P. ξ 66) ὥσπερ τὸ ζῇν καὶ τὸ φρονεῖν τῷ α’ἔρι καὶ τὰς αἶα-θήσειν
ἀνάπτει, and spoke of ὁ ἐντὸς α’ἢρ (the breath or spirit of man) as μικρὸν
μόριον τοῦ θεοῦ. In the Philodemian fragment p. 70 he is referred to in
the following terme, Δ. ἐπαινεῖ τὸν ’Ὅμηρον ὥς οὗ μυθικῶς ἀλλ’ ἀληθεῖς ὑπὲρ
τοῦ θείου διειλεγμένον· τὸν ἀέρα γὰρ αὐτὸν Δία νομίζειν φησὶν ἐπειδὴ πᾶν

Romaim, St Petersburg, 1864, compares the interesting passage in the
comic poet Philemon (Meineke p. 391) ὃν οὐδὲ εἷς λέληθεν οὐδὲ eu ποιεῖν Ι
οὐδ’ ἂν ποιήσων, οὐδὲ πεποιηκώς πάλαι Ι οὔτε θεός, οὔτ’ ἅνθρωπος, οὗτος

Plato: Krische 181—204. The fact that we have, in this 2nd criti-
cism of Plato, no reference to the former contained in ἐξ 18—24 is one
of the arguments alleged to show that this whole section was inserted as
an afterthought. The charge against Plato is (1) inconsistency: at one
time he denies the pofflbility of naming God and forbids us to inquire
into his nature, at another he tells us that the heaven, the stars, the
souls &a are Gods3 (2) these assertione are not only inconsistent but
false’ 1n themselves; (3) particularly the assertion that θοὰ is incorporeal.
With the exception of Sch. all the edd. seem content to understand incon- “
stantia of the first two assertione, that God cannot be named and that he
ought not to be made the subject of investigation; but as these are
evidently quite consistent, Sch. holds that the opposition lies between them
on the one hand and the assertion of the incorporeal nature of θοὰ (quod
υπο-ἇσωματον) on the other. He allows that the grammatical connexion
of the two sentences is very different from what we should have expected
if they were intended to have this relation to one another, but offers no
explanation or suggestion. It seems to me plain that, as the latter
stands, it is impossible to suppose them thus related; and no less plain
that the sentence beginning with idem (a word constantly employed to
mark the coexistence of two apparently inconsistent facts) refers back
to the qui in Timaeo of the first sentence. The opposition between
