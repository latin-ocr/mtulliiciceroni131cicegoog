scena yuryustium q’uc intus obscurius fit? where qur-9. dus seems to mean
the hollow depth of the arbour, agreeably to Vanic'zek's account (Etym.
Νότε. p. 50) where he connects it with ,quo-90⁸, voro, &a and supposes it to ,
mean a ‘swallow' ‘abyss'‚ ‘hele' and then ‘a dark mean dwelling'.

solitudo queat? The Epicuream following Aristotle made the happiness
of God consist in the contemplation of his own perfection §51, which is
not however inconsistent with a delight in his perfection as reflected in

the &gastau-roro dicitis. The Stoic belief that the universe was made for

apientiamne. The earlier Stoice divided all mankind into the wise or
virtuous (for Zeno summed up all virtue in practical wisdom φρόνησις) and
the fools or wicked, allowing of no mean between these extremes cf. Ac. 11
136, Parad. 5, 6, Ν. D. 111 79, Pin. Π 74: the later Stoice confessed that
the Sage was merely an ideal not to be found on earth, and introduced an
intel-mediate class of the προκόπτοντες, those who were on the way to
wisdom.

de improbis bene merentur. Absence of compa-asion, contempt for
ignorance and weakness, despair of reformatiom were characteristic marks
of the old aristocratic philosophice, in conti-ast to the new religion which
was to be preached in the first instance to the poor. The Epicurean here
thinks it impossible that God should do a kindness to bad men or scole,
who in the same ‘breath are spoken of as most miserablez the Gospel
mognizee human misery and sin as the strongest claims to the divine
compassion. cf. Orig. c. Cels. 111 59 and 62.
