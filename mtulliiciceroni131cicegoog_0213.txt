is an explanation of the belief of the vulgar, the absurdities of which
are shortly aster pointed out ε how far Lucretius himself allowed eviden-
tial weight to these visions is not clear. In 1v 26 foll. he gives as his
reason for discussing the nature of the images (simulacra) the fact that
they take the shape of the dead and cause terror by presenting themselves
to us both awake and asleep, neforto anima-5 Acherunte reamur Ι effugere aut
umbra-s inter vivos volitare Ι ‚ and in 722 foll. he shows how such simulam-a
may ariae spontaneously in the air. It seems therefore that these images
can only be trusted in so far as they are supported by abstract reasoning.
Compare also Sext. Emp. Mada. 11 25 (quoted by Mum-0) Ἐπίκουρος δὲ ἐκ

τοῖν κατὰ τοὺς ὕπνους φαντασιὸν οἴεται τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ἔννοιαν ἕσπακίναι θεοῦ·
μεγάλων γὰρ εἰδώλων, φησί, καὶ ἅνθρωπομόρφων κατὰ τοὺς ὕπνους προσπιπτόν-
των ὑπέλαβον καὶ ταῖς ἀληθείαις ὑπάρχειν τινὰς τοιούτους θεοὺς ἀνθρωπομόρ-
φους. The Stoic Balbus is in agreement with Epic. on this point3 and
Aristotle (quoted by Sextus l. c.) made these appearances one of the two
causes 'bo which he traces the origin of religion, ἀπὸ δυοῖν ἀρχῶν ἔννοιαν θεοῖν
ἕλε-γε γεγονέναι, ἀπό τε rev περὶ τὴν ψυχὴν συμβαινόντων καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν μετεό·
· ρον, the former owing to τοὺς ἐν τοῖς ὕπνοις γιγνομένους ταύτης ἐνθουσιασμοὺς
καὶ τὰς μαντείας· ὅταν γάρ, φησίν, ὃν τῷ §moer καθ’ ἑαυτὴν γένηται ἡ ψυχή,
τότε τὴν lotar ἀπολαβοῦσα φύσιν it exercises a prophetie power, just as
Homer tells us it does at the moment of death ς ἐκ τούτων οὖν ὑπενόησαν οἱ

ἅνθρωποι εἷναί τι θεὸν τὸ καθ’ ἑαυτὸν ἐοικὸς τῇ ψυχῇ καὶ πάντων δπιστημονικό·

τοι-ον. See H. Spencer Principleo οἱ Socidoqy ch. x and Tylor quoted
below.

primas notiones: answering to natura above. We find the correspond-
ing Greek term used of the προλήψεις in Diog. L. x 38 ἀνάγκη γὰρ τὸ πράθον
ἐννόημα καθ’ ἕκαστον φθόγγον βλέπεσθαι καὶ μηθὲν ἀποδείξεως προσδεῖσθαι
(if we are to have any standard of reference).

ne omnia—ad primas notiones. The πρόληψις which arises instinct-
ively from the repeated appearances of Gods is contrasted with the ab-
straet reasonings which follow. The Gods must be of human shape, for
the most perfect nature must be also the most beautiful, and the human
shape is more beautiful than any other3 again, happiness cannot exist
without virtue, nor virtue without reason, nor reason except in human
shape. The former argument is criticized ξ 77-86, the latter § 87-89.

ξ 47. praestantissimam: ‘we are justified in believing that the most
exalted of beings, whether we regard his happiness or his eternity‚ must be
also (eandem) the most beautiful '. It would seem that both here and in ξ 45
we must explain the causal clauses vel quia and mom et aeterna by a reference
to pacatam.

figura: the mathematical outline, a matter of fact; species, outward
appearance as distinguished from the inner nature 3 forma (ξ 48), the form
artistically viewed as symbolizing the inner nature.

vos quidem—divinam: ‘ you Stoice at least are wont, in displaying
the skill of the divine artificer’, see 11 87 and 134, and for fabr. ξ 19 n.
