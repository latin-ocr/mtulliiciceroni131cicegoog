quid est istuc grassum: ‘ what do you mean by this phrase of
yours‘l ³ In the uss these words stand before sumpsi-sm, and Walker
followed by Davies and Ernesti omitted them as an expression of bewilder-
ment on the part of some ignorant frater-malus, but gradatim is not a
particularly puzzling word3 and the clause comes in quite naturally with
Faociolati's transposition. The emendation qui (Sch. Opux. 111 p. 325)
is unnecessary ε it only expresses in a literal prosaic way what is implied
by quid3 cf. N-D. 11121 cummundo mqmquabquamemnoelim, quid dahis

formae figuram ‘the outline of their shape’, see ξ 47 n. If this is a
genuine phrase, and not a gloss for formam, its precision was probably
intended to prevent the misapprehension of formam in the sense of
‘beauty'. Sch. quotes Lucr. Π 67 formai servare fiyuram, and Off 1 126

nati numquam sunt. Immortality was the most universally accepted
of the divine attributes, but this was not understood to mean eternity. On
the contrary, detailed accounts of the birth of the reigning gods of Olympus
were to be found in the poets, and even the primaeva-l gods were supposed
tohave sprung from Earthand Chaos. Yet we find traces of the higher
doctrine, as in the oracle of Dodona reported by Pausan. x 12 5 Ζεὺς ἦν,
Ζεὺς ἔστιν, Ζεὺς ἔσσεται, ὅ μεγάλε 2⁶5,- and Plut. Stoic. Rep. 38 p. 1051
treats this as the universally accepted opinion, φθαρτὸν καὶ γεννητὸν οὐδείς,
ὥς ἔπος εἰπεῖν, διανοεῖται θεόν (N ag N. Hom. Tloeol. pp. 9, 71).

siquidem aeterni sunt futuri: ‘that is, if they are to be eternal’ (as
you Epicureans hold, cf. §§ 45, 49, 107, 109). The Fut. Part is used
