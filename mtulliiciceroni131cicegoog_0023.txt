GREEK runosorm‘. xxiii

Euclides of Megara, the founder of the Megaric and so ultimately
of the Sceptic school, was chiefly attracted by the negative teaching
of Socrates, and his followers are nowd as the inventore of various
sophisma which served them as offensive weapons against their
opponente. The main positive doctrine attributed to them is that
they identified the Good, which Socrates called the highest object of
knowledge, with the Absolute One of Parmenides, denying the existence
of Evil.

Antisthenes (N. D. 1 32), the founder of the Oynic and indirectly
of the Stoic school, was the caricature of the ascetic and unconven-
tional side of Socrates. Nothing is good but virtue, nothing evil but
vice. Virtue is wisdom, and the wisc man is always perfectly happy
because he is sels-sufficient and has no wants, no ties and no weak-
nesses. The mass of men are fools and slaves, and the wise man
is their appointed guide and physician. Acting on these principles
the Cynics were the mendicant Friars of their time, abstaining from “
marriage and repudiating all civil claims while they professed them-
selves to be citizens of a world-wide community. On the subject of
religion Antisthenes stated explicitly, what was doubtless implied in
the teaching of Socrates, that there was only one God, who is invisible
and whose worship consiste in a virtuous life.

Aristippus of Cyrene (N. D. 111 7 7 ), the founder of the Cyrenaic
school, resembled Antisthenes in dwelling exclusively upon the prac-
tical side of his master’s teaching. He interpreted the· somewhat
ambiguous language of Socrates about happiness in a purely eudae-
monistic sense and declared that the only rule of life was to enjoy
the present moment. Wisdom was essential to this, as it freed the
mind from prejudice and passion. It was the boast of Aristippus
no less than of Antisthenes ‘mihi res, non me rebus subjunyere
coewr'. Among the more prominent members of this school were
Theodorus (N. D. 1 2, 63), surnamed the Atheist, who lived towards
the close of the 4th century, Ro. He objected to the doctrine of his
predeceoeor on the ground that it did not leave sufficient scope to
wisdom, since pleasure 'and pain are so much dependent on outward
circumstances3 and put forward as the chief good not the enjoyment
of passing pleasure, but the maintaining of a calm and cheerful frame
of mind. Euhemerus, whose religious system is referred to by Cicero
(N. D. 1 119), was a pupil of his. His contemporary, Hegesias, called
πεισιθάνατος from his gloomy doctrine, considered that as life has
more of pain than pleasure, the aim of the wise man should be not
