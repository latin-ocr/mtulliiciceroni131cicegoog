Cum sint—tum est. Heindorf with some of the less important uss
reads eunt, ‘ sermonis leqi convenienter',· but both constructions are allow-
able, see Madv. Fin. 1 19, Roby Gr. ἐξ 1734, 1735. The Ind. which is
found inthe very similar passageDivim17cum omnibucinrebus temeri-
tas turpis est, tum in eo loco maxim which concerns religion, is more
naturally used in comparing particular cases (‘as—so' ‘both—and’); the
Subj. views the particular cese in relation to the general principle, as in
Off. 111 5 omn coca phaosophia ftuquera sit, tum nullm feracior in ea locu-3
eet quam de offic-iah, and Lael. 23 with Seyffert’s note. Translate, ‘while
there are many questions in philosophy which are far from having been
fully cleared up, there is one of special difficulty, I mean the inquiry into
the nature of the gods '. [‘I think that in nearly all the passages where
cum—tum is used by O. there is a conti-ast between a general statement
and a particular case, whether the clause with cum contains an Ind. or a
Subj. 11· the cwm clause introduces a fact viewed as a concession made
by the speaker, then the Subj. is necessary ; otherwise not '. J. S. R.]

ad agnitionem animi pulcherrima: ‘ennobling as regards our recog-
nition of the soul' s nature’. For construction cf. 1 98 ad figuram quae
