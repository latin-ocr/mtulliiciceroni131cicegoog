· in animi notione-reponere Here at last we have the open avowal
of the principle on which the criticism is founded; all is false which dis-
agrees with our πρόὶυγψις. According to Epicurus repeated impressions
(sensatione) fix a type (πρόληψις) 111 the mind, to which we attach a name,
and when any new object offers itself, claiming to be called by this name,
we-must measure it by the type. So Cleanthes said that each perception
(φαντασία) made an impression on the soul like that made by a 8081 011

serts his belief in the divinity of the souls of the good, (Oomol. fr. 5,) which

was indeed a part of the ordinary Roman belief, and is recognmd as such

from disturbing the religious beliefs of the vulgar, endeavoured to find 8
place for these in their philosophy, explaining each divinity as a separate
manifestation of the one supreme God, and getting rid, as far 88 they

could, of immoral or degrading superstitious by the free use of allegory. But
it was scarcely possible to do this with the mass of the inferior deities,
