‘ innate ideas’ in the sense in which Locke (certainly not Plato, for with
him the idea was latent till developed by μαιευτική ; nor Desoartes, see
Huxley's Hume p. 83) understood the term. Au that is implied is that
our religious ideas are not arbitrarily imposed from without, but grew
up within as a natural and necessary result of experience. We must
understand innatum in the same sense in 11 12, of. Sch. Opux. Π 345, who
remarks that a principio iamai is the phrase used (11 34) of what is
strictly inborn.

the motive of anger, which might lead to their infliction 01· trouble, and the
motive of favour, which might· lead to their taking trouble for others, are
alike 'manifestations of weakness‚ and inconsistent with our idea of the
Divine majesty. The answer to which is that (1) the word ‘ trouble ’ is
unmeaning in reference to our idea of God: if we suppose him to be
almighty, thought and action are as easy to him as breathing to us:
(2) while it is true that passion and caprice are marks of wealmess and, as
such, inconsistent with our idea of God, yet a righteous government, re·
