the lights to which the division of night and day is owing. Plato would
not have allowed that time existed even as indefinite duration before
the universe came into being. ⁴ With the rotation of the Kosmos began
the course of time, days, months and years: anterior to the Kosmos
there was no time, no past, present or future, no numerable or measurable
motion or change '. Grote's Plato 111 256. ’ In Plato’s own words ἦ μὲν

So also Arist. De Caelo 1 9 7 ‘ there is neither place nor time outside the
circle of the heavens (for time is but the measure of motion) but only a
divine unchanging eternity’.

the words quodne—essens a gloss. The meaning of the passage is then
simple and consistent, ‘what was the creator doing during all the ages

which preceded the making of the world? For though time was not then
portioned out by the movements of the heavenly bodies, yet there must

have been a boundless eternity which we can conceive as extended. WeH,

with the ordinary reading (defended by Sch. in his note and also in opusc.
111 299) we have a thought introduced which is not only out of place, but
totally inconsistent with the argument. It is not for Ven. to dwell upon
the difficulty of conceiving the existence of time prior to mention: that is
a point for his opponente to press. According to the reading which Ι have
adopted he merely alludes to it to show that it does not invalidate his
argument, and proceeds with an igitur which would be very ill-suited to
the other reading. The particle tamen just above would be equally in-
appropriate aster quam nulla—metiebatur: there 1s no opposition between

appropriateness of the proposition in the mouth of Vell. the language is
too verbose for the short staccato style of the rest of his speech. Yet
again, the sentiments in themselves are non-Epicurean. Infinite time and ‚
infinite space are not unintelligible to an Epicurean. Lucretius has no
hesitation in telling us what was the state of things before the atoms hap-
pened on the existing cosmos with its sun and moon and stars. Scu’s
