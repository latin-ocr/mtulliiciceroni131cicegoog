This was at Rome about nc. 88, but in '79 C. in company with Atticus
attended lectures at Athens by Zeno and Phaedrus, Fin- 1 16 eos cum
Attiou nostro frequenter andivi, cum miraretur ille quidem utrimque,
Phaedrum autem etiam amaret, ci Pin. v 3, Leq. 1 50, and see Introduction.
cum—Aristotelem vexarit: ‘ and yet Epic. attacked A.’; of. Roby
ἐξ 1730, 1732. We find vexo similarly used in ξ 78 and Τυεσ. v 25 vexatur
Theophrastus et libras et scholis omnium philosophorum. Diog. L. gives speci-
mens of the abusive language which, he says, was falsely imputed to Ep.
(μεμῆνασι δέ οὗτοι x 9) ; Plato and his friends he styled Διονυσιοκόλακας,
Δῐίεΐῡῦθ ficos-ov, Democritus Ληρόκριτον, &c- x 8 3 cf. Plut. M. 1086 (speak-
ing of Ep. and Metr.) τὰ ἐν ἀνθρώποις αἴσχιστα ῥήματα, βωμολοχίας, ληκυ·

οὐχὶ τῶν ἐπιφανῶν κατεσκέδασανς similarly Plut. (Μ. 1108) describes the
treatise of ColoteS, entitled περὶ τοῦ ὅτι κατὰ τὰ τῶν φιλοσόφων δόγματα
οὐδὲ ζῆν ἔστιν, as a πίνακα τεράτων, consisting of parts of sentences wrested
from their natural signification and spiced with rudeness and buffoonery.
Even (1., though far from mealy-mouthess makes a protest against the
abusiveness of Greek controversy, Ru. 11 80 sic ista in Graeoomm levz‘tau

Phaedoni—male dixeriiz: Ph. was a well-born native of Elis, taken
prisoner and sold as a slave in Athens Rc. 401, where he attracted
the notice of Socrates and was ransomed by one of his disciples. He was
present whilst Soc. uttered the famous discourse on immortality which is
known to us as the Phaedo. Some time after his master's death he
returned to Elis, and founded the Elean school of philosophy, which
appears to have been closely allied with those of Eretria and Megaris.
We read of a treatise of Epicurus which bore the name of διαπορίαι πρὸς
τοὺς Μεγαρικούς, and it is possible that Phaedo may have been criticized in
this. The epithet turpissime refers, we may suppose, to the deffiadation
he underwent as a slave, as Diog. (11 105) tells us of another opponent
who taunted him with this misfortune‚ cf. Zeller, Socrates p. 279 tr.
Timocratem: a disciple of Ep. described as fickle (Diog. x 6) and hot-
tempered (Philod. De Ira Gomp. p. 48), who left him in consequence of a
difference of opinion as to the grounds of happiness, cf. ξ 113. Duening
(Metrodorus p. 23) thinks that the quotations there given are from atreatise
by his brother Metrodorus περὶ τοῦ μείζονα εἶναι τὴν παρ’ ἡμᾶς αῖτίαν πρὸς
εὐδαιμονίαν τῆς ἐκ τῶν πραγμάτων, and that Metr. is not there contrasting
bodily and mental pleasure, but pleasure which originates ab intra with
that which originates ab extra, but see Hirzel p. 165 foll. Other grounds
of qum-rel are mentioned by Duening p. 24. After this breach Timoc. seems
to have used every effort to injure his former associates, charging them
with debauchery of every ln‘nd in his Euphranta, as well as inveighing
against them in public, cf. Aloiph. Ep. 11 210 τί ποιεῖς, Ἐπίκουρει οὔκ
οἶσθα ὅτι διακωμφδεῖ σε Τιμοκράτης ἐπὶ τούτοις δν ταῖς ἐκκλησίαις, ἐν τοῖς
