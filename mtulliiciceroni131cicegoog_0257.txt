BOOK 1 CH. xxm § 81. 185

tamenne: so Hac. 21, Ao. 11 26 and without m, Fam. lx 193 see
Lewis and Short av. 11 o 3 for the position Div. in Coeo. 21, Act. 1v 16.

ea facie novimus: Abl. of Quality, cf. ξ 49 soliditate quadam matur
(according to Hirzel’s interpretation). In such ceses we supply in thought
some part of the verb substantive.

at non Aegyptii. So Xenophanes, according to Theodoret 111 p. 49,
τοὺς Αἰθίοπας μέλανας καὶ σιμοὺς γράφειν ἔφησε τοὺς οἰκείους θεοὺς, ὁποῖοι δὴ
καὶ αὐτοὶ πεφύκασι· τούς δέ γε Θρᾶκας γλαυκούς τε καὶ ε’ρυθρόυς· καὶ μέντοι καὶ
Μήδους καὶ Πέρσας σφίσιν αὐτοῖς ἐοικότας, καὶ Alvum-‘'ovs- αἶσαύτως. Of. Tylor
Prim. Calc. 1 p. 278 ‘the south-African, who believes in a god with a
crooked leg, sees him with a crooked leg in dreams and visions ’ (quoted
from Livingstone); ‘when the Devil with horns, hoofs and tail had once
become a fixed image in the popular mind, of course men saw him in this
conventional·shape'. ,

barbaria: ‘ the uncivilized world ', a collective name like our ⁸ Christ-
endom', cf. Fin. 11 49 non solum Graecia et Italia ced etiam omnis
barbaria.

opiniones de bestiis: ‘ beliefs in certain brutes', cf. 29 n.

§82 fana spoliata: cf. Sall. Cat. v 6 of the evil effects of Sulla's
conquesta ibi primum insuevit exercitus P. R. delubra epoliare, sacra pro-
fanaque omnia miseere, and the 4th Verrine Oration. ι

fando auditum t ‘ none have heard tell'‚ cf. Roby ξ 1239, Prqf. mxv·

crocodilum. See more in ξ 101 and 111 47 and compare Tmo. v '78
Ae9yptiorum morem quie iymorat f quonam imbutae numm pravitatis errori-
bus quamvis car-ruffinam prius subierint, quam ibim aut aspidem aut faelem
aut canem am crocodzzum molent, quorum etianwi imprudentes quippiam
fecerint, poenam nullam recusent, Herod. 11 65 τὸ δ’ ἄν τις τῶν θηρίων τούτων
ἀποκτείνῃ, ἦν με“ν ἐκῶν, θάνατος ἦ ζημίη, ἢν δὲ α’ἐκων, ἀποτίνει ζημίην τὴν ἂν οἱ
ἷρίες τάξωνται· ὃς δ’ ἦν ἶβιν ἢ ἴρηκα ἀποκτείνῃ, ἥν τε ἑκῶν ἤν τε ἀέκων, τεθνάναι
ἀνάγκη. Cambyses is said to have taken advantage of this superstition,
and placed dogs, sheep, cats and ibises in the van of his own army, Αἰγυπ-
τιοι δὲ βάλλοντες ἐπαύσαντο, φόβῴ τοῦ πλῆεαί τι τῶν ἱερῶν ξύων, Polyaenus
VI c. 9. See also Diod. 1 83 and the quotations from the comio poets in
Athen. vn 55, esp. that from Timocles, which is given also in Philodemus
p. 86. Different animals were counted sacred in different parts of Egypt
as appems from Juvenal Sat. xv ; see the, very full notes, and reff. on the
Egyptian religion generally, contained in Mayor's ed„ and for the crocodilo,
his n. on crocodilon adorat. In Wilkinson's Auden& Egyptians (ch iv. small
ed.) there is a list of the sacred animale, mentioning where they were
worshipped—with what deity each was associated. The later mythology
explained this animal-worship by the transformations which the Gods
underwent in their sear of Typhoeus, cf. Ov. Met. v 325 Ιιτιο quoque (to
Egypt) ten-iqenam venisse Typhoea narrat—et sc mentitis superos celasse
βριθὺ, Jupiter in the ram, Mercury in the ibis, &c For the modern views

see Tylor P. 0. 11 208—224.
