Boon 1 cn. xxx ξ 82. 187

there was any single type known under the name of June Romana ,· Ο.
probably refers to the general difference between the Greek Hera and her
Roman counterpart3 cf. Miiller A. A. ξ 120.

ch. m§ 83. physicum: see §7¹7 n. and Wilkins on Orac. 1 217, where
the Gk. form is used.

venatorem: cf. the metaphorical use of θηρεύειν in Plato, and espe-
cially the ‘ view-hollo ² on the discovery of justice, Rep. Π 432 ο; so Hume
‘ there cannot bs two passions more nearly resembling each other than
bunting and philosophy ’, Huxley's Hume p. 141. ,

consuetudine imbutis: Bacon's idola tribus. See N. D. 11 45.

laudamus Athenis Vulcanum: ⁸ yes, and at Athens we admire' i. e.
‘ there is a statue of V. at Athens'; cf. Mayor on J uv. v 42 praeclara illic
laudatur iaspis who quotes Fin. 111 63 illa qaae im concha patula pinna
dicitur, and compares (index s. v.) the poetical construction with καλεῖσθαι
uelum, as in Soph. Traclz. 639.

Alcamenes: a pupil of Phidias and one of the greatest of Greek
sculptors. A list of his works is given in Sillig's Dietionaty of Artius.
Some of these have been lately discovered at Olympia, casts of which may
be seen in the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge. The Vulcan is thus
described by val. Max. vm 11 tenet νὼσηιεε Athenis Vulcanus Alcamenis
manibus fabricatus. Praeter cetera· enim perfecti-ssimae mis in eo prae-
currentia mdwia eciam illud mirantur, quod atat dib-simulatae claudicationis

ita tamen certam propriamque dei notam decore siqniftcam.

age et his—facimus: passing on to the names of the Gods, ‘do we
suppose (are we such fools as to suppos& cf. n. on arbitrantia· ξ 80) that
they have also the same names as those by which they are lmown to us ’2
The first Abl. is that of Description (Roby ξ 1232) the second that of Man-
ner (Roby ξ 1234). On aye Orelli quotes from Madv. Op. Ac. 11 40 ‘de
‘⁴ aye ²’ interrogationi praeposito, cf. 11 120 Tmo. 111 49 Phil. v 28'3 see
Roby ξ 1609. On the adverbial use of et see ξ 72 n., and Hand 11 513, 517,
Kiihner on Tusc. 111 28 referred to by Sch. Many exx. are given by
Dumesnil on [ορ. 1 33. The argument as to names is added as a sort of
corollary to the previous argument on the appearance of the Gods. That
was a fair enough criticism on the prolepsis, and this, though, at first sight,
a mere reductio ad absurdum, is to some extent justified by the Epicu-
rean doctrine that names existed φύσει οὖ θέσει.

ξ 84. quot hominum linguae: sc. sunm ut tu Velleius: sc. enh,- cf.
ἐξ 68, 90, and Draeg. ξ 116.

idem Vulcanus: ‘ you are always Velleius, but Vulcan (i.e. the God of
fire) does not bear the same name in Italy as in Africa or Spain ³. Four
different Vulcans are distinguished in 111 55, one of whom is the Egyptian
Phthius, but we have no information as to a Spanish Vulcan, though it is
natural to suppose that there may have been a god of mining in a country
so rich in metals.
