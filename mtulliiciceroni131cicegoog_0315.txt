⁸⁰ A great and ood service lm been done
to all students o history,·and especially to
those of them who look to itin alegal aspect,

bring clearly under the notice of the student,
and the result is that there is not a page in
the book which lias not its own lesson .....
ln all respects, so far as we have been able
to test it, this book is admirably done.”—
Scotsman.

“Mr Willis-Bund has edited ‘A Selection
of Cases from the State Trials· which is
likely to form a very valuable addition to
the standard literature. . . There mn
be no doub therefore, of the interest that
ωτι be foun in the State trials. But they
are large and unwieldy, and it is impossible
sor the eneral reader to come across them.
Mr wifiis-Bund has therefore done. good
service in making a selectton that is in the
first volume reduced to a commodioris form.’'

“This work is a very useful contribution
to that important branch of the constitutional
history of England which is concerned with
the growth and development of the law of
treasom as it may be gathered from trials be-
fore the ordinary courts. The author has

that the only wonder is that no one should
have undertaken it before....1n many
respects therefore, although the trials are
more or less abridged, this is for the ordinary
student's purpose not onl a more handy,
but a more useful work n Howell's.”—

“ Mr Willis-Bund gives a νέςκιηέ of each
case as it comes, only quoting from the re-
ports where the words of the original are
important in themselves, and very osten
statin the point deeided in his own words.
By fofiowing this method he is able to intro-
duce extraneous matter wlnch does not
strictly belong to the case in hand, such as
Acts of Parliament, and in that way to make
his book both more intelli 'ble and more in·
teresting. In the severa trials which we
have read he has done his work very well.
The book should be ve interesting to the
historical student. . . . rom what we have
seen of this book we have great pleasure in
oecommending nt.”-Guardmn.

‘⁴ Mr Bund's object is not the romanoe.
but the constitutional and legal bearings of
that great series of causes calebo-es which is
unfortunately not within easy reach of
readers not happy enough to possess valna-
ble libraries. . . . Of the importance of this
subject, or of the want os a book of this
kind, referring not vaguely but precise! to
the grounds of constitutional doctrines, th
of past and present times, no reader os his·
tory mn feel any doubt.”—Daily Nms.

THE FRAGMENTS OF THE PERPETUAL
EDICT OF SALVIUS JULIANUS,

collected, arranged, and annotated by BRYAN WALKER, Μ.Α. LL.D.‚
Law Lecturer os St John's college, and l'ate Fellow of Corpus Christi

College, Cambridge.

“This is one of the latest, we believe
quite the latest, of the contributions made to
legal scholarship by that revived study of
the Roman Law at Cambridge which is now
so marked a feature in the industria} lise
of the University. . . . In the present book
we have the fruits of the same kind of
thorough and well-ordered study which was
brought to bear upon the notes to the Com-

mentaries and the institutes . . . Hitherto
the Edict has been almost inaccessible to
the ordinary English student, and such a
student will be interested as well as perhaps
surprised to find how abundantly the extant
fragments illustrate and clear up points which
have attracted his attention in the Commen-
taries, or the Institutes, or the Digestf—

Law Times.
