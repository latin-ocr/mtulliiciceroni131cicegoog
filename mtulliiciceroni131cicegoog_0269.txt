ante igitur-immortales. Bake’s reading eaque, adopted by Baiter,
seems fo me to give the thought rather awkwardly, as though the human
form were something sslf-existent, and happened fo be also an attribute of
the gods. If an alteration is needed, Ι should prefer to insert a second di
immortales before humana forma, translating ‘ so the gods existed in human
form before men existed in that form which belonged to the gods '. With
the present reading, humana somna must be Nom. ; ea is also so taken by
Moser and Seibt, and, if one may judge from the punctuation, by Scho-
mann, but this seems to me extremely harsh3 the only possible construc-
tion is quam homines ea (forma erant) qua erant forma di.

sense that the Epicurean poet says denique caelesti eumue omnes semim
oriundi, Lucr. 11 991. The enclitic interrogative, when it is not attached
to the principal verb, is often expressive of surprise, and suggests a nega-
tive answer (Madv. ξ 451 a), as here minans, and omnesne below.
