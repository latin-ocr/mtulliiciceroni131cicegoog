appetitive (τὰ ἐπιθυμητικόν) and the spirited (τὰ θυμοειδές) which it
had to bring into subjection. If it succeeded, it returned to its
star on the death of the body3 if it failed, it was destined to
undergo various transmigratione until its victory was complete. In
all them physical speculatione Plato was much influenced by the
Pythagoream.

We have now to speak of his ethical doctrines, which were
based upon the psychological views mentioned above. The soul is
on a small scale what the State or city is on a large scale: it is a
constitution which is in its right condition when its parts work
harmoniously together, when the governing reason is warmly sup-
ported by its auxiliary the beart, and promptly and loyally obeyed
by the appetites. Thus perfect virtue arises when wisdom, cour-age
and temperance are bound together by justice. The highest good is
the being made like to God3 and this is effected by that yearning
after the Ideal which we know by the name of Love (N. D. 1 18—24,

30 aa).

Aristotle (lonqe ,omnbus—Platonem semper caspio—praestans et
inqenio et dv’liqentia, Tunc. 1 22) was born at Stagira, a Greek colony in
Thrace, in the year 385 Β.ο. He came to Athens in his l7th year
and studied under Plato for twenty years. In 343 m). he was
invitcd by Philip, King of Macedon, to superintend the education
of his son Alexander, then a boy of 13. When Alexander set out
on his Persian expedition Aristotle returned to Athens and taught
in the Lyceum. As he lectured while walking, his disciples were
called {eripetetics On the death of Alexander, Aristotle left Athens
to escape {roffi charge of impiety, and settled at Chalcis in Euboea,
where he died 322 Β.ο.

Aristotle's philosophy may be roughly described as Plato put into
prose and worked out in detail. The vague mysticism‚ the high
poetic im’agination, of the master was altogether alien to the
scholar, but the main lines of the two systems are the earne.
Plato's Dialectic method was developed by Aristotle int-‚0³ the
strict technical science of Logic: Plato's Ideas were shorn of their
separate supra-mundane existence and became the first of the four
famous Censes of Aristotle, tbe formal, the material, the efficient, the
final, which are really four kinds of antecedent conditi ans required
for the existence of each thing. For instance, in order to the pro-
duction of a marble statue by Phidias there is needed (1) the pre-
