that he knows no example of praeterea quod used in the sense of praeter
quam quod ,· and if Ο. had meant this, why should he not have said simply
et inf et eL? Ι think too the context shows that infinitum must be taken as
belonging to the subject ᾗ Vell. objects not to τὸ πᾶν being called ἄπειρον,
but ιο ’τὸ ἄπειρον being called Ouia. And the same appears from the
quotation in Minucius c. 19 X en. notum eet omne efflatum cum mente deum
tradere. Ι believe that Ο. 18 translating some such origIml 88 τὸ πᾶν,
λογικὸν ὃν καὶ ἄπειρον, θεὸν εἶναι, and that he 1188 here turned a quality
into an independent substance, as was done above in the case of Thales, and
also of Democritus (ξ 99). Τ11811 praeterea quod emt (or perhaps praeterea
alone) seems ιο 1118 8 gloss intended ιο sosten the apparent contradiction

[Ι 8111 inclined to think that X. used ἄπειρον 111 ι118 881188 of ‘indefinite'‚ and
that the true reading here isproptoeemnotpraeterem X'sGodwasGod
just because he had no definite organs (οὖλος ὁρᾷ διο.) like the anthropo-
morphic Gods. J. S. R]

blame, for vacancy is the only infinite, and in this there can be no feeling
and no connexion with any thing exter-nal (such 88 mind) since it includes
all things in itself. There seems no ground for Kr.’s supposition that

view that it is synonymous with continens in ξ 26. The easiest reference is
plainly to the preceding meme aeliza-ricta, and if so, it is an additional argu-
ment against the genuineness of the weak addition praeterea quod uod,-
, which would just serve to turn the edge of the criticism.

vol. 1 109—130. As X.’s theology was found in 1118 account of τὸ ὅν,
any rational investigation of the development of theologica-1 thought ⁶
would have shown us in what respects his disciple's view of the τὸ ὅν
differed from his; but the Epicurean· critic has no eye for anything

, but names, and finding the word θεός occurring siequently in P.’s popu-

lar account of the phenomenal world, he confines his attention to this,
regardless of the fact that, whether named or not, the idea of divinityx
is 88 much involved in P.’s higher philosophy as in that of many oi
1118 predecessore, and also forgetting that the cosmical system of Par-
menides is in the main taken from Pythagoras and should have been
criticized under his name. The doctrine here alluded ιο 18 given by Stob-
