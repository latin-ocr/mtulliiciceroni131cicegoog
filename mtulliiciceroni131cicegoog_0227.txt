coryphaeum. Ko ⁶ ς, from κορυφή (113311 used metaphorically like
vertex and apex), has the general sense cf ‘ 3 leader’ in Herodotus ; but in
later writers is commonly employed in the narrower sense of ‘leader- of the
chorus’ (the ἔξαρχος of older poeti-y), cf. Donaldson Theatra of tlte Greeks

ferring to Cotta his own part in the Academica.
