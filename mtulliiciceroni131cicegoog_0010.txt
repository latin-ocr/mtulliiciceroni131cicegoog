PREFATORY NOTE.

ab Cambridge, and to my former pupil, Mr Η. Ρ.
Richards, now F ellow and Tutor of Wadham College,
Oxford; but above all to Mr J. S.. Reid, whose
name is well known to scholars from his excellent
editions of the Academica and other works of Cicero,
and bo my old and valued friend Mr H. J. Roby.
The help which I have received from the two latter
is only imperfeotly represented by the additions and
corrections marked with the signature R„ in the ease
of those supplied by ΜΓ Roby, and ‘J. S. R„ in the
ease of those supplied by Mr Reid. Many of my own
notes have been modified‚ and perhaps more should
have been, in deference to their candid and searohing

criticism.

The remaining volume will, I hope, be eomplebed
for publieation during the course of next year.

April, 1880.
