some such clause as motatum autem est innostro empore nimio affici aut
ealon-e aut sn’ym. He would therefore omit quodque—etiam dei alto-

- gether, oonsidering the first part a gloss on the preceding sentence, and

the latter part a gloss to give pmcision to the argument of the following
quoniam mundi partes sunt ,· (it would also be necessary to change the
following atqui into atque). 1 see no objection to the former clause, if
we mept Lachmann's emendation sio &mutetur ‘if it is carried along so
fast' instead of the us reading eiynffioefur, which there is no authority
for interpreting (with Wyttenbaoh in loc. and Beier Off. 1 46) to mean ‘if
there were the slightest hint (saintest traoe) of it'. Sch.'s emendation
(Opmo. m 284, 303) sio afficiatur only adds an obscurer εἰσ ιο the obscure
quod. Another objection ιο the , us reading might be that minim& ex
parte, though true enough if we imagine our body hurried along by itself
with the velocity then attributed to the sphere of the fixed stul-s, would
be absurd exaggeration if spoken with reference ιο our power of enduring
tropieal heat or aretio oold; but we must remember that the ancients,
in their ignoranoe of geography, really believed that human life was in-
supportable exeept in the temperate zones. On the whole Ι have thought
it better ιο follow the uss, though 1 am not satisfied that the text is
correct.

nullam video. Is it not the Subj. in orat. obl. after maanus? Previous to
subordination the clause would be incultae sune quod παγαὶ The mood is
changed, not because the speaker diselaims responsibility for the statement,
but merely to show that quod gives the reason for menatae, not for the
prinoipal verb.
