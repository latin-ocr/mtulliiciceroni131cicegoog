in solum venit: ‘ turns up ², ‘ is brought on the tapis'. The origin
of the phrase is doubtful: Manutius, in his n. on Fam. 11 26 inconvivio
loquor quod in solum, ut dabitur, suggests that it refers to chance-sewu weeds,
but 1 think the word solum would be more naturally used in reference to
what comes from above than from below3 perhaps it may be connected
with the legal ree soli ⁶ whatever comes on , the ground ' (counts as real
property). [May not the phrase mean literally ‘meets the foot'‚ ἐμποδὼν
γίγνεταιῗ Cf. quidquid in buccam, in mentem venit. J. S. R]

quae primum nullae sunt: ‘for in the first place there are no such
things as atonis ', cf. ξ 61.

nihil est enim-corpore. Lambinus saw that some words must
have been lost between ”enim and quod, and the gap has been supplied
as follows by Sch. (partly from the parallel passage in Ac. 1 27) quae
pimum nullae sum: nihil eat enim ‘in rerum natura niinimum quod
dividi nequeat', to which he adds deinde, nt sint, moveri per inane non
poscunt, siquidem id dicis inane quod vacet corpore, thus providing an in-
telligible meaning for enim and primum, see his Opuec. 111 287. Primum
however might correspond to ξ 68 concedam—quid ad rem ,θ And the autent
which follows corporibus (unless with Heind. we read enim instead,
according to one osthe codd. Elimia, so as to give a reason for moveri non
potest) would suit better with some such context as this, moveri nisi per
inane nonpommt ; inam autem id dicis ease quod vacet corpor& emporibus

views of Leucippus and Democritus cf. Introduction and R. and P.
§§ 79, 80.

Oh. mv ξ 66. physicorum oracula fundo: ‘in this 1 am merely
the mouthpiece of our scientific oracles '. On orac. cf. Orat. 1 200, domm

Cato and other writers on agriculture), σειν non videantur eramala ?...ex

the natural philosophers in Fin. 1 20 ne illud quidem phyn'm‘ (est) credere
